{"query": "2015 South India floods\n\nThe 2015 South India floods resulted from heavy rainfall generated by the annual northeast monsoon in November–December 2015. They affected the Coromandel Coast region of the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. [12] More than 500 people were killed and over 1.8 million (18 lakh) people were displaced. [13] With estimates of damages and losses ranging from nearly ₹200 billion (US$3 billion) to over ₹1 trillion (US$14 billion), the floods were the costliest to have occurred in 2015, and were among the costliest natural disasters of the year. [18]\n\nThough the unusually heavy rainfall in southern India during the winter of 2015 has been attributed to the 2014–16 El Niño event, in July 2018 the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) categorised the flooding across Tamil Nadu as a \"man-made disaster\", and held the Government of Tamil Nadu responsible for the scale of the catastrophe, which the latter had termed a natural disaster. [19]\n\nFrom October to December each year, a very large area of south India, including Tamil Nadu, the coastal regions of the Andhra Pradesh and the union territory of Puducherry, receives up to 60 percent of its annual rainfall from the northeast monsoon (or winter monsoon). The northeast monsoon is the result of the annual gradual retreat of monsoonal rains from northeastern India. Unlike during the regular monsoon, rainfall during the northeast monsoon is sporadic, but typically far exceeds the amount produced by the regular monsoon by up to 90 percent. This excessive rainfall can be exacerbated by an El Niño of order of the magnitude which has since been evaluated to every year, such as 2015. [20]\n\nThe coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh usually bear the brunt of heavy rains that occur during the northeast monsoon; with numerous river systems and wetlands, Puducherry and eastern Tamil Nadu are prone to flooding. [20] The city of Chennai alone experienced five major floods between 1943 and 2005, with the 1943, 1978 and 2005 floods causing particularly severe damage. [21] In addition, unplanned and often illegal urban development has led to many wetlands and natural sinks being built over; this, along with ageing civic infrastructure and poorly designed drainage systems, has resulted in an increased frequency of severe flooding. [20]\n\nOn 8 November 2015, during the annual cyclone season, a low-pressure area consolidated into a depression and slowly intensified into a deep depression before crossing the coast of Tamil Nadu near Puducherry the following day. Because of land interaction and high vertical wind shear, the system weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area over north Tamil Nadu on 10 November. [22] The system brought very heavy rainfall over the coastal and the north interior districts of Tamil Nadu. On 13 November, Kanchipuram recorded 340 mm of rain and several low-lying areas were inundated and Vembakkam close to Kanchipuram recorded 470 mm. On 15 November, a well-marked low-pressure area moved northwards along the Tamil Nadu coast, dropping huge amounts of rainfall over coastal Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh with 24‑hour totals peaking at 370 mm in Ponneri. Chennai International Airport recorded 266 mm of rainfall in 24 hours. On 28–29 November, another system developed and arrived over Tamil Nadu on 30 November, bringing additional rain and flooding. The system dropped 490 mm of rainfall at Tambaram in 24 hours starting 8:30 am on 1 December. Very heavy rains led to flooding across the entire stretch of coast from Chennai to Cuddalore. A study from IISc shows that on 1 December, clouds were stationary over Chennai. [23] This study showed that the mountains of Eastern Ghats blocked clouds that came from the Bay of Bengal from moving further inland. The mechanism is referred to as 'upstream blocking'. Therefore, they were stationary over Chennai throughout the day. These clouds gave continuous rainfall over Chennai that caused massive flooding. Between 9 and 10 November 2015, Neyveli received 483 mm (19.0 in) of rainfall; rains continued to lash Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram and Chennai. [22] Several low-lying areas in Kanchipuram, including major thoroughfare Gandhi Road, were inundated as the city and its neighbourhood received a heavy precipitation of 340mm during the 24-hours that ended with 8.30 a.m. on 13 November 2015. The Manjalneer Kalvai, primarily a flood drain channel for the city, overflowed after the Netteri lake breached on the Kancheepuram-Vellore Road in the wee hours of Friday, flooding the entire stretch of Gandhi Road and Munusamy Mudaliyar Avenue and forcing the police to close for traffic the prime junction Moongil Mandapam where the Gandhi Road joins with Vallal Pachaiyappan Salai. Kanchipuram Collector R.Gajalakshmi told reporters later that a total of 7,294 persons were rescued from inundated areas and accommodated in 26 shelters opened by the civic body. Boats were used to rescue the people from inundated areas in Pillayarpalayam, the Collector said. And also Vembakkam close to Kanchipuram recorded 470mm of rain on 13 November 2015. Continuing rains led to low-lying parts of Chennai becoming inundated by 13 November, resulting in the evacuation of over 1000 people from their homes. [12] The flooding in Chennai city was worsened by years of illegal development and inadequate levels of flood preparedness. [24] Much of the city remained flooded on 17 November, though rainfall had largely ceased. [25] Chennai received 1,049 mm (41.3 in) of rainfall in November, the highest recorded since November 1918 when 1,088 mm (42.8 in) in of rainfall was recorded. Kancheepuram district registered the heaviest rainfall—183% higher at 181.5 cm as against average rainfall of 64 cm in October–December period and Tiruvallur district recorded 146 cm compared to average 59 cm of rain. The flooding in Chennai city was described as the worst in a century. [28] The continued rains led to schools and colleges remaining closed across Puducherry and Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts in Tamil Nadu, and fishermen were warned against sailing because of high waters and rough seas. [29]\n\nThough rainfall from the earlier low-pressure system ended on 24 November, another system developed on 29 November, bringing additional rain and the India Meteorological Department predicted heavy rainfall over Tamil Nadu until the end of the week. On 1 December, heavy rains led to inundation in many areas of Chennai. [32] By afternoon, power supplies were suspended to 60% of the city while several city hospitals stopped functioning. [33] The same day, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa announced that, because of the continued flooding and rains, half-yearly school examinations originally scheduled for 7 December would be postponed until the first week in January. [34] For the first time since its founding in 1878, the major newspaper The Hindu did not publish a print edition on 2 December, as workers were unable to reach the press building. [35] The Southern Railways cancelled major train services and Chennai International Airport was closed until 6 December. [33]\n\nChennai was officially declared a disaster area on the evening of 2 December. [28] At the MIOT Hospital, 14 patients died after power and oxygen supplies failed. With a letup in rainfall, floodwaters gradually began to recede in Chennai on 4 December, though 40 percent of the city's districts remained submerged and safe food and drinking water remained in short supply. [36] Though relief efforts were well underway across most of the area by 3 December, the lack of any coordinated relief response in North Chennai forced thousands of its residents to evacuate on their own. [37] As intermittent rains returned, thousands of displaced residents from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts attempted to flee the stricken region by bus or train and travel to their family homes.", "label": [{"name": "洪水", "arguments": {"日期": "November–December 2015", "原因": "heavy rainfall", "受影响地区": "Coromandel Coast region of the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh", "疏散数量": "7,294 persons were rescued", "人员伤亡": "14 patients died", "经济损失": "200 billion (US$3 billion) to over ₹1 trillion (US$14 billion)", "受影响地区的最大降雨量": "1,088 mm (42.8 in)"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

{"query": "Northern Cape farmers affected by the locust outbreakThe brown locusts, mostly found in the semi-arid Karoo region of the Northern Cape, Eastern Cape and Western Cape, can migrate over large areas and have  been detected in several towns in the province. The Northern Cape Department of Agriculture, Environmental Affairs, Land Reform and Rural Development's (DAEALRRD) Director for climate change and disaster management Ikalafeng Kgakatsi says the locusts often target the green, leafy part of plants. Kgakatsi says: “The brown locust hatches in high rain areas. With the heavy rains around the province, we are experiencing a lot more of them than we normally would have. In the past few weeks, we’ve seen a significant increase in the pests.” Kgakatsi says the spread of the locusts can be managed by spraying a pesticide that DAEALRRD freely avails to farmers. The pest, found in solitude or large groups, is identifiable through its various colours, according to Kgakatsi. The locust begins life as a white locust and then turns red. At this stage, they are still small. Once red, the locust develops the ability to hop. At full maturity, it turns brown and can fly great distances, says Kgakatsi. He says the ability to fly enables the brown locust to damage crops for hundreds of kilometres. “We’re also working with farmers to target farms that have experienced the impact of the locusts. We compensate them for using their spraying equipment to help us combat the pests.” The locusts, which are mostly active during summer, often use unused farmlands as breeding grounds. Kgakatsi says locusts can hatch up to 500 eggs at a time, which can remain undeveloped for months. Kgakatsi has urged farmers to assist by reporting sightings of these locusts, as they could have a serious impact on their production and the general economy of the province. To combat the spread of the locusts, the DAEALRRD has appointed locust control contractors and is distributing insecticides, protective clothing and spray pumps.", "label": [{"name": "虫灾", "arguments": {"受影响地区": "semi-arid Karoo region of the Northern Cape, Eastern Cape and Western Cape", "支援机构": "the DAEALRRD", "害虫": "The brown locusts", "受影响的作物和生计": "crops", "应对措施": "We compensate them for using their spraying equipment to help us combat the pests", "援助物资/数量": "distributing insecticides, protective clothing and spray pumps"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n The Round, which seeks to liberalize trade in a host of economic sectors, broke down at a ministerial meeting in Cancun last September when a group of poor countries led by Brazil and India demanded that Washington and Brussels commit themselves to sharp reductions in agricultural subsidies that they argued were making it impossible for farmers in poor countries to compete.\n The World Bank has estimated that estimated US$300 billion in annual subsidies and other support given to farmers by western governments are costing developing countries some $60 billion a year, more than the total amount of official economic aid that these same governments and international agencies, like the World Bank, provide them annually in grants and loans.\n The agreement on a framework for further negotiations was concluded by a small group of countries, including the U.S, the EU, Australia, India and Brazil, that were delegated to hammer out a consensus for moving forward.\n \"Today's decision is a crucial step for global trade,\" said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick shortly after the WTO secretariat announced the accord. \"After the detour in Cancun, we have put these WTO negotiations back on track.\"\n The Brazilian delegate, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, also put the best spin on the final agreement, insisting, \"This is the beginning of the end of (agricultural) subsidies. It is a rare combination of social justice and trade coming together.\"\n But the NGOs were considerably more skeptical in their assessments, insisting that the results were considerably less balanced than Amorim had suggested.\n Calling it a \"face-saving exercise,\" Greenpeace said the final result was \"highly imbalanced in favor of rich countries, which make vague promises in return for key concessions by developing countries,\" particularly in opening their markets wider to manufactured goods, services, and agricultural exports from wealthy nations themselves.\n In addition, the Amsterdam-based group charged the accord will \"open the door for further liberalization in sensitive sectors such as fisheries and the trade in forest products.\"\n \"The deal is not a victory for multilateralism, but a dangerous fudge,\" said Daniel Mittler, Greenpeace International Trade and Policy Advisor. \"The secretive process practiced in Geneva this week once again showed that the WTO is an undemocratic organization mainly responsive to rich-country interests. The WTO does not seem capable or willing to deliver equitable and sustainable development for all; it only seems to be interested in ensuring its own survival.\"\n Friends of the Earth International (FoEI) also complained about what it called \"undemocratic procedures and intense pressure\" from the U.S. and the EU in the rush to secure a final accord.  \"Corporate lobby groups will be the big winners, the environment and the poor the big losers,\" said FoEI's Alexandra Wandel, point in particular to the agreement on Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA), a part of the framework accord which calls for the liberalization of all natural resources, particularly in fisheries, gems, and mining. NAMA would make it much more difficult for developing countries to protect these resources from foreign investors or collect revenue from their export.\n \"The NAMA agreement could further deepen the de-industrialization crisis in these countries, thus accelerating unemployment and poverty and forcing countries to rely heavily on unsustainable and harmful exports of natural resources.\"\n At the same time, FoEI charged that the \"so-called concessions\" made by the EU and the U.S. in agricultural negotiations - a commitment to cut some farm subsidies by 20 percent - may \"turn out to be empty promises.\"  \"The commitment to eliminate export subsidies credits is missing any substance as no end-date is mentioned in the text,\" the Brussels-based group said. \"On domestic support for agriculture, language in the framework agreement clearly opens the door for the EU and the U.S. to maintain nearly their entire level of current subsidies and to use these to continue the dumping of agricultural goods in developing-country markets. At the same time, developing countries could be forced to give up import protections used to achieve food sovereignty.\"\n That criticism was echoed by Oxfam which called the agreement \"deeply disappointing and not sufficient to meet the needs of developing countries\" and warned it may indeed cause the Round to collapse before their scheduled completion in late 2006.\n\"The draft is unacceptable because it fails to meet the needs of developing countries,\" said Charveriat. \"Presented as a breakthrough, the text on agriculture does little to address the problem of export dumping, instead introducing dangerous loopholes for yet more subsidies from the U.S.\"\nShe stressed that the framework failed to address the issue of U.S. cotton subsidies that were recently ruled illegal by the WTO itself. Instead, the issue of cotton is to be folded into overall agricultural negotiations without any specific commitment to eliminate them.\nProduction in the heavily subsidized U.S. cotton industry has had the effect of driving down global prices for a key commodity to levels that threaten the livelihoods of millions of small-scale cotton farmers in poor countries, particularly in West Africa. To gain an agreement from key West African cotton-producing nations - namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali - Washington agreed to accelerate cuts in its subsidies and mobilize more development assistance. On the other hand, the four countries - the last three of which are among the world's poorest nations - agreed to lower tariffs to agricultural imports, a concession likely to increase U.S. food exports to them.\nBut Charveriat said the deal was unfair, particularly because the WTO had already ruled that the U.S. subsidies were illegal. \"This is a serious betrayal of developing countries and will have massive implications for the 10 million West African farmers whose livelihoods are currently undermined by U.S. export dumping,\" she said. \"There are no cast-iron commitments here and no clear timeline for reform.\"", "label": [{"name": "签署协议", "arguments": {"地点": "Geneva", "日期": "the early hours on Sunday", "缔约成员大会（合同当事人）": "the World Trade Organization", "协议内容": "puts developing countries in the unfair position of having to accept a bad deal or reject and get blamed by the U.S. and the EU for failure"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

{"query": "Turkish-backed Syrian armed groups unify forcesALEPPO, Syria — The areas controlled by the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the countryside of Aleppo in northwest Syria have recently witnessed the merger of a number of factions under new names. Most recently, on May 30, three military factions of the Syrian National Army (SNA) affiliated with the FSA in the countryside of Aleppo announced their merger under the name of the First Division. The factions that merged are the Ninth Division’s Brigade 143, Brigade 111 (Northern Brigade) and Brigade 112. A statement issued by these factions read, “In the framework of this restructuring operation within the ranks of the SNA and following the approval of the FSA’s First Legion and chief of staff, we announce our complete integration under the name of the First Division operating within the ranks of the First Legion.” In this context, Capt. Abo Jalal, commander of the newly formed First Division, told Al-Monitor, “This merger affirms our commitment to strengthen and support the SNA institution to achieve more progress. It reflects our insistence on defeating crime and protecting and preserving the dignity of the Syrian people who believe in the revolution and the struggle for liberation and change.” In a parallel event May 28, three SNA factions also announced their merger under the name of the 13th Division. A statement announcing the merger read, “As part of efforts to organize the ranks of the military forces, we, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Brigade, the Semerkand Brigade and al-Wakkas Brigade, announce our complete merger under the name of the 13th Division.” Col. Ahmed Hamadeh, military analyst and defected Syrian officer, praised the integration of the SNA factions. He told Al-Monitor, “This will positively reflect on the performance of armed factions in the battlefield. The reduced number of factions and the merger of small factions under a unified command will definitely lead to a better military organization and discipline. The SNA has three legions, and each legion includes a number of factions. The less factions there are, the more centralized the decision-making process will be.” He added, “The mergers take place in coordination between the leaders of the factions and the Ministry of Defense of the opposition’s [self-styled] interim government. When the merger agreement is reached, the minister of defense issues the relevant executive order. Each faction has to implement the administrative and military procedures related to this merger.”  A military official in the Ministry of Defense of the Syrian opposition’s interim government told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, “The merger between the factions is an administrative and organizational restructuring process within the SNA. We first discussed this step at the beginning of this year through consultations between faction leaders and officials in the Ministry of Defense.” He noted, “We are trying to take advantage of this period of calm to rearrange the internal ranks and prepare for any upcoming confrontation or battle with more efficient performance and organization than before.\" He pointed out that the interim government’s Ministry of Defense will continue its efforts in this context and integrate more factions to facilitate their leadership, organization and control of their members and prevent any violations. Col. Mustafa Bakkour, a Syrian army defector residing in Idlib, told Al-Monitor, “The SNA makes changes from time to time within its administrative structure for several reasons. These most notably include the formation of large military groups under one leadership and with one goal. These steps aim to avoid the multiplicity of authorities, conflicting decisions and competition among leaders. [The recent mergers] are a good call.” He said, “Since its establishment, the SNA factions have been working under the supervision of the Turkish army. I believe all organizational matters and decisions taken by the factions regarding mergers and other organization steps are with the direct support and blessing of the Turkish army, which aims to develop this military opposition institution.”  The SNA controls the countryside of Aleppo, in addition to the areas of Ras al-Ain in the northwest of Hasakah province, and Tell Abyad, north of Raqqa province. On Dec. 30, 2017, the formation of the SNA was established by a military group in the Syrian opposition. On Oct. 4, 2019, the head of the opposition’s interim government, Abdul Rahman Mustafa, declared the merger of the SNA and the National Liberation Front (NLF) into one army, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Defense in the interim government. Speaking to the press in Sanliurfa, Turkey, Mustafa said back then that this army seeks to free Syria from corruption, sectarianism and dictatorship, and to defend Idlib, Hama and the countryside of Latakia. He added that the unified SNA will strive to “return Syrian land to Syrians.” As of 2019, the SNA included all the factions that were affiliated with it and formed in December 2017, in addition to 11 factions of the FSA-affiliated NLF that was established in Idlib in May 2018. The merger between the SNA and the NLF brought the number of overall fighters to 80,000, according to the interim government.", "label": [{"name": "组织合并", "arguments": {"被合并的组织名称": "Brigade 112", "合并后的组织": "the Ministry of Defense", "日期": "Oct. 4, 2019"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

{"query": "July_2016 The Turkish government dismisses nearly 1,400 military personnel for alleged links to exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen. (Reuters)ANKARA/ISTANBUL, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkey dismissed nearly 1,400 more members of its armed forces and stacked the top military council with government ministers on Sunday, moves designed by President Tayyip Erdogan to put him in full control of the military after a failed coup.\nErdogan tightens grip on the military\n01:19\nThe scale of Erdogan’s crackdown - more than 60,000 people in the military, judiciary, civil service and schools have been either detained, suspended or placed under investigation since the July 15-16 coup - has unnerved Turkey’s NATO allies, fuelling tension between Ankara and the West.\nAdding to the acrimony, Turkey’s EU Affairs minister hit out at Germany on Sunday after its constitutional court upheld a ban on Erdogan making a televised address to a rally of pro-government Turks in Cologne.\nThe new wave of army expulsions and the overhaul of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) were announced in the official state gazette just hours after Erdogan said late on Saturday he planned to shut down existing military academies and put the armed forces under the command of the Defence Ministry.\nAccording to the gazette, 1,389 military personnel were dismissed for suspected links to the Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who is accused by Turkey of orchestrating the failed putsch. Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States, has denied the charges and condemned the coup.\nIt comes after an announcement last week that more than 1,700 military personnel had been dishonourably discharged for their role in the putsch, which saw a faction of the military commandeer tanks, helicopters and warplanes in an attempt to topple the government.\nAbout 40 percent of Turkey’s generals and admirals have been dismissed since the coup, in which Erdogan says 237 people excluding the plotters were killed and more than 2,100 wounded.\nThe government also said its deputy prime ministers and ministers of justice, the interior and foreign affairs would be appointed to YAS. The prime minister and defence minister were previously the only government representatives on the council.\nThey will replace a number of military commanders who have not been reappointed to the YAS, including the heads of the First, Second, and Third Armies, the Aegean Army and the head of the Gendarmerie security forces, which frequently battle Kurdish militants in the southeast. The changes appear to have given the government commanding control of the council.\nErdogan, who narrowly escaped capture and possible death on the night of the coup, told Reuters in an interview on July 21 that the military, NATO’s second-biggest, needed “fresh blood”.\n‘BACKSLIDING’\nGerman media said authorities had decided to bar Erdogan from addressing a rally via videoconference in the city of Cologne on Sunday due to concerns over public order, prompting an angry response from Turkey’s EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik.\n“German Constitutional Court’s decision on the anti-coup rally in Cologne is an utter backsliding in freedom of speech and democracy,” he said in English on Twitter.\nRelated Coverage\nGermany is home to Europe’s largest ethnic Turkish diaspora.\nThe rally in Cologne, in which Turks waved national flags and pictures of Erdogan, was one of several planned on Sunday in European as well as Turkish cities and towns.\nErdogan has upbraided Western leaders for not visiting Turkey since the coup. He said it was “shameful” that some in the West seemed more concerned about the fate of the plotters than in standing with a fellow NATO member.\nThe aggressive military purges come at a time when the armed forces is stretched by fighting with Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey and threats from Islamic State militants on its border with Syria. Four soldiers were killed by the Kurdish militants on Sunday in two separate incidents, officials said.\nTurkey’s military is taking part in the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Its Incirlik Air Base is used by coalition forces for missions against Islamic State.\nSecurity was tight in the immediate area around Incirlik on Sunday, Turkish security sources said, before an expected visit by the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joseph Dunford.\nWhile there were rumours on social media that security forces were at the ready on worries about another coup attempt, a U.S. military spokesman at the base said they had not seen an increased Turkish police presence.\n“It’s business as usual here,” he said, without giving his name. “We are not seeing anything like that.”\nIncirlik has seen some scattered protests in the days since the coup as pro-government supporters have called on the United States to extradite Gulen. Washington says it will only do so if it receives clear evidence of Gulen’s involvement in the coup.\nDunford’s visit comes at a delicate time for Turkey’s relations with the United States, given Erdogan’s constant demands for Gulen’s extradition.\nWith mass purges of suspected Gulen supporters well underway in all state institutions, the media and some private companies, the Turkish Football Federation said on Sunday all its affiliated boards had resigned for the sake of “security checks”. It said it was cooperating fully with the authorities.\nErdogan told broadcaster A Haber on Saturday that Gulen was a “pawn” being controlled by a greater power.\n“There is a mastermind behind him. That mastermind is the one who took him to the United States and who helped him avoid any judicial process,” he said.\nConspiracy theories have flourished in Turkey since the attempted coup, with one pro-government newspaper saying the putsch was financed by the CIA and directed by a retired U.S. army general using a cell phone in Afghanistan.\nThe United States has denied any involvement and any prior knowledge of the coup attempt.\nErdogan has said that Gulen harnessed his extensive network of schools, charities and businesses, built up in Turkey and abroad over decades, to create a “parallel state” that aimed to take over the country.\nThe government is now going after Gulen’s network of schools and other institutions abroad. Since the coup, Somalia has shut two schools and a hospital believed to have links to Gulen, and other governments have received similar requests from Ankara, although not all have been willing to comply.\nIn an unexpected move, Erdogan has said that as a one-off gesture, he would drop all lawsuits filed against people for insulting him. He said the decision was triggered by feelings of “unity” against the coup attempt.\nIt could also be aimed at silencing his Western critics.\nProsecutors have opened more than 1,800 cases against people for insulting Erdogan since he became president in 2014 after serving as prime minister for 11 years. Those targeted include journalists, cartoonists and even children.\nAdditional reporting by Gulsen Solaker in Ankara, Humeyra Pamuk, Ayla Jean Yackley and Daren Butler in Istanbul and Seyhmus Cakan in Diyarbakir; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Gareth Jones and Richard Balmforth\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

{"query": "Banja Luka incident crash\n\nThe Banja Luka incident, on 28 February 1994, was an incident in which six Republika Srpska Air Force J-21 Jastreb single-seat light attack jets were engaged, and four of them shot down, by NATO warplanes from the United States Air Force. U.S. F-16 fighters southwest of Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina successfully engaged and destroyed several Bosnian Serb warplanes which had attacked a Bosnian factory, while suffering no casualties of their own. It marked the first active combat action, air-to-air or otherwise, in NATO's history. [5]\n\nIn February 1994, the 526th Fighter Squadron, \"Black Knights\", based at Ramstein AB, Germany, was attached to the 401st Operations Group (Provisional) operating out of Aviano AB, Italy, as part of NATO's Operation Deny Flight. On 28 February, a flight of two 526th F-16s, \"Knight 25\" and \"Knight 26\", were crossing over Croatian airspace to conduct Close Air Support training near Sarajevo, Bosnia, when they detected six unidentified radar contacts eastbound in the No Fly Zone. These contacts were not immediately visible to the NATO AWACS aircraft flying over Hungarian territory because of distance and hilly terrain. After several minutes, AWACS was able to establish contact south of Banja Luka at 6:35 a.m. Two other 526th Squadron F-16s, Black 03 and Black 04, were vectored to the area and intercepted six J-21 Jastreb and two J-22 Orao aircraft that were bombing the \"Bratstvo\" military factory at Novi Travnik. [6]\n\nIn accordance with the UN and NATO rules of engagement, orders to \"land or exit the no-fly zone or be engaged\" were issued twice, but both warnings were ignored. While warnings were issued, the violating aircraft dropped bombs over their target, which was left in flames. In such circumstances NATO has a \"single key\", meaning that only one clearance was needed, so the Combined Air Operations Center was immediately able to clear the F-16s to attack. The Bosnian Serb Jastrebs headed northwards, back to their base. At 6:45 a.m., the NATO fighters engaged their opponents. Captain Robert G. Wright fired an AIM-120 AMRAAM, downing the first Jastreb which was flying at 1,500 metres (4,900 ft). The remaining Jastrebs dropped to a few hundred metres, flying at low level to use the mountainous terrain to hide from radar and make their escape back to Udbina. Wright pressed on, closing to within AIM-9 Sidewinder range. He engaged two aircraft with heat-seeking Sidewinder missiles, shooting them both down. After he had expended all his missiles and low on fuel, Wright handed over the chase to his wingman, Capt. Scott O'Grady, who had been flying 'top cover' above his flight leader. O'Grady dropped down to engage and fired an AIM-9M; the missile locked on and near explosion of the warhead triggered by the proximity fuse severely damaged the tail of the targeted Jastreb. Black flight was now approaching \"bingo fuel\", the point at which a plane will not have enough fuel to return, so they pulled off to refuel from a KC-135 Stratotanker circling in orbit over the Adriatic. At the same time the other pair of F-16Cs, \"Knight 25\" and \"Knight 26\",[7] had been vectored to the area by the AWACS. At 6:50 a.m., \"Knight 25\", piloted by Capt. Steve \"Yogi\" Allen, managed to get in behind a single Jastreb flying at a very low altitude. He launched a Sidewinder, downing another J-21 Jastreb. Knight 25 flight turned back hard to the south, where Knight 26, Col. John \"Jace\" Meyer, established radar lock on another aircraft fleeing to the northwest. After a minute of pursuit, radar contact was lost and the flight broke off the attack. Low on fuel, Knight 25 and 26 returned to the tanker over the Adriatic. After refueling, they resumed combat air patrol over Bosnia. One remaining Serb aircraft was able to land as it ran out of fuel at Udbina Air Base in the Serbian Krajina in present-day Croatia. The USAF credited three kills to Captain Robert Gordon \"Wilbur\" Wright,[8] flying F-16C-40 #89-2137/RS,[9] using an AIM-120 AMRAAM and two AIM-9 Sidewinders; and one kill using an AIM-9 Sidewinder to Captain Stephen L. \"Yogi\" Allen[10] flying F-16C-40 #89-2009/RS[11] of the same unit. The Bosnian Serbs acknowledged the loss of five aircraft in the incident; the discrepancy probably stems from the fact that an additional aircraft crashed after being hit by a missile explosion[12] while trying to escape in low-level flight.

Farmers called the authorities as soon as the locusts arrived. Authorities used planes to spray the swarm, and while some died most ended up in Kimanzi's fields. \"The locusts appeared, and we called the authorities immediately. The aeroplanes started the spraying from that edge of the river. Some died, but the rest of the swarm moved to our farms. They destroyed everything here then. They have now moved to our homes. They are now laying eggs there,\" Kimanzi said. She has only managed to harvest one bag of millet and one bag of lentils since the locust invasion. \"The rest of the crops were all destroyed,\" she said. \"There is nothing left.

{"query": "2017 Baduria riotsBaduria riot refers to incidents of communal violence between Hindus and Muslims in the Baduria town in Basirhat subdivision of the North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal state of India. Tensions started rising after a social media post on Islamic prophet Muhammad and Kaaba by a 17-year-old student on 2 July 2017. The images were seen as objectionable and went viral in Baduria. He was later arrested. It is claimed that this violence was an outcome of local outrage of the Muslim groups, but according to some news sources and local media, villagers of Baduria, Basirhat and of its neighborhood claimed the rioters were outsiders.\n\nFollowing the post made on 2 July by the school boy, a mob of an estimated 5,000 people blockaded the Baduria police station, demanding that the accused be brought before the crowd. The post also resulted in an arson attack on the accused's house. He was arrested on the evening of 3 July 2017. The Muslim religious leaders of the area tried to pacify the rioters and urged them to retreat. However, the mob continued their vandalism, demanding the accused be handed over to them. \n\nThe Baduria police station was attacked and set ablaze along with several police vehicles on the night of 3 July. A violent mob put up road blockades at several places and attacked members of other community, besides destroying many shops. \n\nMuslim mobs set upon shops and houses belonging to Hindus in Baduria, Swarupnagar and Taki. Rath Yatras at several places were attacked.  Violent clashes were triggered between the two communities of Basirhat. [19] The Union government deployed four Border Security Force (BSF) companies containing a total of 400 personnel to check the violence in the region. Section 144 was imposed while the internet services were suspended.In retaliatory attacks on 6 July, Hindu mobs attacked a dargah and vandalised shops and houses in addition to clashing with the police. The office of a local TMC leader also comes under attack.On July 7, several Hindu temples were attacked by a Muslim mob of about 70-90 people. They also allegedly attacked and harassed Hindu families.\n\nAbout 25 people including 20 policemen were reported to have been injured in the violence.The house and party office of a local TMC MLA Dipendu Biswas was also set on fire by the rioters. A 65 year old died after being stabbed by the rioter mobs in the clashes while trying to return home. His son saved another villager, Fazlul Islam, whom he brought to hospital along with his father. \n\nDuring this riot, while Muslim mobs attacked house of the main accused, Muslim neighbors were seen calling fire service and protecting his home,while later it was found to be rumoured[27][28][29][30] where leaders of the local Muslim community tried to pacify the riot which proved to be a failed attempt. [31][32] Later, as sign of religious harmony, local Muslim community pooled money to help the affected Hindu neighbors targeted in this riot,[33][34][35] and both communities joined to restore normalcy in this area. \n\nVijeta Malik who is reported to be the Haryana State Executive Member of BJP allegedly posted a well-known scene of a Bhojpuri movie Aurat Khilona Nahi and cited it as an incident  in Baduaria clashes where Hindu women were severely abused and the crowd just watched. This fake news went viral. Despite several appeals from Kolkata and West Bengal Police, sharing of fake news continued and tensions were exacerbated. One Kolkata-based Bhabotosh Chatterjee, was arrested for sharing fake news and spreading communal hatred over the internet, and another three were held for spreading fake news via multiple social media profiles. In July, two FIRs[clarification needed] were lodged against a Delhi-based BJP leader Nupur Sharma for sharing fake news while the BJP IT cell secretary Tarun Sengupta was arrested in Asansol for posting ‘fake’ video on social media. The West Bengal Government ordered a judiciary inquiry on the fake news propaganda and the causes of the Baduria incident.

{"query": "Nipah Virus Kills 12-Year-Old Boy In India, Raising Outbreak ConcernsWhite House Mandates Pfizer Vaccines for Millions of Citizens ...Before the FDA Clinical or Safety Reviews Have Been Made Public The Nipah Virus may not be as transmissible as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but previous outbreaks have shown that it can spread among humans fairly rapidly. Plus, there are currently no established vaccines against or treatments for Nipah Virus infections. While that may keep anti-vaxxers from saying, “don’t take the Nipah Virus vaccine because it will make your keys stick to your forehead,” it also means that there is currently little humans can do to prevent the spread of the Nipah Virus except for non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, face mask use, hand hygiene, and disinfecting surfaces. Therefore, a Nipah Virus epidemic could catch many countries with their pants down around their ankles just as the Covid-19 coronavirus did in early 2020. Typically, there are three ways you can catch the Nipah Virus. One is by direct contact with infected animals such as bats and pigs or their body fluids. This is yet another reason why playing with bat or pig urine, blood, or saliva is a bad idea. Another way of being infected is by eating contaminated foods. So if the menu says “with or without bat poop,” choose the “without” option. Bats are known to poop in food items such as palm sap or fruit because they frequently don’t have manners or know how to use public restrooms. Bats can also nibble at food like fruit leaving them contaminated. So avoid anything that looks partially eaten and forego that intimate dinner with bats regardless of how much you want to re-create that Lady and The Tramp scene with a noodle and a bat. Also, immediately discard any food or water that may have been touched by bats in any way. “Let’s store it in the room with all those bats” are words that should rarely come out of your mouth. The third way of contracting the Nipah Virus is from close contact with an infected human or his or her body fluids. Again it’s risky to play with any body fluids such as nasal or respiratory droplets, urine, and blood regardless of whether they’re from humans or other animals. It shouldn’t be comforting to hear the words “don’t worry it’s only human urine” when someone throws such a liquid in your face for example. Public health experts have known about the Nipah Virus since 1999 when an outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore ended up infecting nearly 300 humans and killing over 100 in Malaysia and Singapore. Pigs were involved as well, as over one million pigs were culled in efforts to stem the spread of the virus. Since then other outbreaks have occurred, mainly in Bangladesh and India. The flying fox is a known reservoir for the Nipah Virus. (Photo by Sylvain CORDIER/Gamma-Rapho via ... [+] Getty Images) Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images While the virus can infect different animals, the main reservoir appears to be the fruit bat (genus Pteropus), otherwise known as the flying fox. The Nipah Virus is very similar genetically to the Hendra virus, another henipavirus that bats carry. So it will be important to give a flying fox about what happens to the virus in that population. If you do get infected by the Nipah Virus, you probably wouldn’t recognize what happened right off the bat, so to speak. It takes time for symptoms to emerge, usually anywhere from four to 14 days. The most common initial symptoms are fever and headache, which may be accompanied by respiratory issues, such as a cough, a sore throat, and difficulty breathing, as described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . This initial phase of infection can last from three to 14 days. During this initial phase, there aren’t obvious specific symptoms that make you go, “oh, yeah, this is Nipah.” So diagnosis will require real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of different body fluids. This can include samples of cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and blood as well as the oh-so familiar swabs of your throat and nasal passages. Some infections don’t proceed beyond this initial phase. You may end up having nothing more than mild symptoms. However, this doesn’t mean that you should say, “oh, my doctor told me that it’s only a Nipah Virus infection. I can just walk it off.” A significant percentage of infections progress to encephalitis, which is when the brain gets inflamed. Symptoms include drowsiness, disorientation, confusion, and seizures. You can fall into a coma rapidly within 24 to 48 hours. Many people don’t survive when this has happened, which means that you “Nipah” take all infections with this virus seriously. After you’ve recovered from the infection, you may develop antibodies in your blood, which can be detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. However, it’s not completely clear what kind of protection such antibodies may offer against future Nipah Virus infections. Of course, the situation in India doesn’t mean that you should panic. Public health officials will rarely say, “OK, time for everyone to panic. So raise your hands above your head, start yelling, and run in circles. And buy lots and lots of toilet paper.” Plus, one case doesn’t mean a large outbreak yet. And an outbreak wouldn’t necessarily progress to an epidemic. And an epidemic wouldn’t necessarily evolve into a pandemic. A lot would have to have to happen for this latest Nipah Virus situation in India to become a major concern. Nevertheless, this situation is a reminder that other viruses and pathogens don’t take a vacation just because the SARS-CoV-2 is causing a pandemic. Other pathogens don’t say, “OK, you got this” to the Covid-19 coronavirus. You never know what other pathogens are currently being batted around and when and where any of these may eventually become even bigger problems.", "label": [{"name": "疾病爆发", "arguments": {"原因": "Covid-19 coronavirus", "受影响地区": "Bangladesh and India", "疾病名称": "encephalitis", "症状": "drowsiness, disorientation, confusion, and seizures", "预防措施": "over one million pigs were culled", "日期": "since 1999", "传播途径": "from close contact with an infected human or his or her body fluids", "确诊/感染病例": "nearly 300 humans", "死亡病例": "killing over 100", "疫情数据发布机构": "the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

{"query": "2019–2020 Catalan protests\n\n Kingdom of Spain\n\nPolice forces:\n\n Supporters of Catalan independence or referendum\n\n Government of Catalonia\n\nThe sentencing of nine Catalan independence leaders in a 2019 trial by the Supreme Court of Spain triggered protests in Catalonia. They were convicted of sedition and other crimes against the Spanish state for their role in the organization of the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. [6]\n\nThe Spanish autonomous community of Catalonia has a long established independence movement, which seeks to establish Catalonia as an independent and sovereign republic, thus breaking off from the Kingdom of Spain. A non-binding 2014 Catalan self-determination referendum resulted in a victory for proponents of Catalan independence (although with a turnout of 37%), which emboldened Catalan authorities to conduct the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, which they deemed would be binding and result in the independence of Catalonia. The Spanish Government, then led by Mariano Rajoy, however, considered this an act of illegal separatism and appealed to the Spanish Supreme Court to block the referendum. The Supreme Court concurred and ordered Catalonia to cancel the referendum. The autonomous Catalan government, however, refused and held the referendum despite the Supreme Court's binding order. The Spanish Government launched Operation Anubis, in which it attempted to forcefully stop the referendum from taking place by raiding polling stations, preventing the printing and publication of electoral materials, taking down websites advocating or providing information for the referendum and prosecuting its organizers. The Catalan government resisted the police operation and carried through with the referendum. By the end of the polling day, the Catalan government had declared that the referendum had been successfully held and announced that over 90% of voters had voted for independence with a 43% voter turnout. Nine days later, citing the result of the referendum, the Parliament of Catalonia voted for and issued the Catalan declaration of independence, which declared an independent Republic of Catalonia. The declaration, however, was in direct contradiction to Article 115 Spanish Constitution, as well as the orders of the Spanish Supreme court and Spanish Government. For this reason, the Spanish government ended the region's autonomy and imposed direct rule over Catalonia, seizing control of the entirety of the autonomous government's institutions and infrastructure. The Spanish Government, along with the far-right Vox Party, then began to prosecute a case against several of the autonomous region's leaders, as well as the organizers of the referendum. They were brought before the Spanish Supreme Court in the trial of Catalonia independence leaders. On 14 October 2019, nine of the Catalan independence leaders were sentenced to between nine and 13 years in prison, with another three being fined. The demonstrations erupted to protest the Supreme Court's ruling shortly thereafter. [6][7][8][9][10]\n\nProtests against the sentencing of the Catalan independence leaders began on 14 October at Barcelona-El Prat Airport just hours after the Spanish Supreme Court announced its verdict. By the afternoon, thousands of protesters had already gathered at the airport, effectively forcing the airport to close. Clashes erupted between protesters and police forces after the latter charged at and attempted to disperse the former with police batons. The Catalan Government, led by the pro-independence Quim Torra called for both the amnesty of the convicted leaders and a renewed attempt to realize Catalan independence. [9][11]\n\nClashes erupted into open violence, as protesters reacted violently at police efforts to end the demonstration, with some demonstrators reportedly throwing rocks and using fire extinguishers against police officers. The Catalan Law Enforcement agency Mossos d'Esquadra, which had previously been accused of aiding the independence movement, replied by firing tear gas at the demonstrators. The pro-independence speaker of the Catalan Parliament condemned the violent incidents and called for peaceful protests against the ruling. [12] The protests grew larger, as more and more Catalans took to the streets. Some demonstrators attempted to storm buildings belonging to the Spanish Government and clashed with police forces. [13] The Spanish Police announced that 51 protesters had been arrested. [14]\n\nOn 17 October, the pro-independence President of the Catalan Autonomous government, Quim Torra, called for an immediate halt to violence and disassociated himself from violent protesters, while at the same time calling for more peaceful protests. Nevertheless, the situation in Barcelona had evolved into open street battles between protesters and police, as both violent demonstrators attacked and provoked police forces, and police officers charged peaceful protesters for their proximity to violent ones. [15]\n\nShortly thereafter, the Catalan President attempted to rally the crowd by stating that he will push for a new independence referendum as large scale protests continued for the fourth day. [16]\nOn 18 October, Barcelona became paralyzed, as tens of thousands of peaceful protesters answered the Catalan President's call and rallied in support of the jailed independence leaders. [17] The demonstration grew quickly, with the Barcelona police counting at least 525,000 protesters in the city. [1]\n\nBy late 18 October, minor trade unions (Intersindical-CSC and Intersindical Alternativa de Catalunya [ca]) linked to pro-independence movement called for a general strike. However, major trade unions (UGT and CCOO) did not endorse the event as well as representatives of the latter contested its very nature as \"strike\". [18] Five peaceful marches converged on Barcelona's city center, essentially bringing the city to a halt. Protesters further blocked the road on the French-Spanish border. At least 20 other major roads were also blocked. Clashes nevertheless took place, with masked protesters confronting riot police by throwing stones and setting alight rubbish bins. [19] 25,000 university students joined in the protest movement by declaring a peaceful student strike. [20]\n\nAs a result of the strike, trains and metro lines saw a reduction to 33% of their usual capacity, while buses saw a reduction to 25-50% of their usual capacity. The roads to the French border remained blocked and all roads leading into Barcelona were also cut. 190 flights in and out of the city were cancelled as a result of the strike. Spanish car manufacturer SEAT further announced a halt in the production of its Martorell plant and most of Barcelona's tourist sites had been closed and occupied by pro-independence demonstrators waving estelada independence flags and posters with pro-independence slogans. [20] The El Clásico football match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid CF was postponed due to the strike. [21]\n\nBy the end of the day, just like the previous days, riots developed in the centre of Barcelona. Masked individuals blocked the boulevard close to the city's police headquarters. Withdrawn to the vicinity of the Plaça Urquinaona, protesters erected barricades setting trash bins in fire and hurled rubble (shattered from the pavement) and other solid objects at riot policemen. [22] The riot units responded with non-lethal foam and rubber bullets, tear gas and smoke grenades. The Mossos used for the first time the water cannon trunk acquired in 1994 from Israel in order to make way across the barricades. [23] The clashes spread to cities outside Barcelona, with Spain's acting interior minister stating that 207 policemen had been injured since the start of the protests, while also noting that 128 people had been arrested by the nation's police forces.", "label": [{"name": "抗议", "arguments": {"抗议原因": "called for both the amnesty of the convicted leaders and a renewed attempt to realize Catalan independence", "地点": "Barcelona-El Prat Airport", "日期": "afternoon", "抗议者": "thousands"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "1934 United Airlines Utah crashThe 1934 United Airlines Boeing 247 crash was an accident involving a Boeing Air Transport-operated United Airlines scheduled flight of a Boeing 247, which crashed in bad weather shortly after departing Salt Lake City, Utah on February 23, 1934, killing all eight on board. The cause was not immediately determined, but poor weather was considered a factor. At 1400 hrs. on Friday, February 23, 1934, United Airlines Boeing 247, NC13357, c/n 1739,[1][2] departed Salt Lake City, Utah, bound for Cheyenne, Wyoming. The weather was poor, with snow and sleet throughout the region, with up to seven inches of snow accumulating in the lowlands and even more at higher altitudes. [3]\n\n\"The last word received by radio from the ill-fated plane was when pilot Lloyd Anderson signalled \"All Okay\" 20 minutes after the departure. When the plane did not arrive at Cheyenne on schedule, an immediate search was started. \"[4]\n\nThroughout Saturday, February 24, aircraft covered the routes the missing airliner might have travelled, and the United Airlines office at Salt Lake City made phone calls \"to all points in the vicinity. None of the efforts brought any definite trace of the lost plane. \"[5] \"Little hope remained for the safety of the crew or passengers of the plane, which it was believed must have crashed in the clouds and fog. Its fuel supply, United Air Lines officials said, would have been exhausted by 6:30 yesterday. \"[6]\n\nH. D. T. Lewis, chief of the United Airlines at Chicago, arrived Sunday to take charge. [7] Chief Pilot H. T. 'Slim' Lewis and his assistant, Leon D. Cuddeback, ordered a search with Rock Springs, Wyo., as the center. [8]\n\nThe air search began at daybreak, February 24, when two planes left the Salt Lake airport, joined by other pilots of the airline and by Lieut. Frank Crismon, a reserve army pilot. They were aided by ground parties searching the mountains to the east. Weather, which Frank Caldwell, operations manager for United, called \"the worst in the history of flying in this region,\" hampered rescue workers throughout the day. [9]\n\nPlanes were sent up, two from Rock Springs, Wyoming, and six from Salt Lake. Lewis concentrated the search in the mountains. \"That plane is not more than 50 miles from here,\" he said. He was right. As Don Broughton and Ed Greer, United Airlines pilots, flew over the area known as Parley's canyon, they sighted the plane, nose down, nearly buried in the deep snow on the side of the canyon. The nose was between two giant pine trees which stood on either side of the plane, almost hiding it from sight. [10]\n\n\"There was no sign of life. [11][12] Broughton radioed the discovery to airline headquarters at Salt Lake City. [13]\n\nA motor caravan was organized at Salt Lake City. Members waded through snow four feet deep for four miles to reach the crash site. Leon D. Cuddeback, assistant to Lewis, was the first company official to arrive. He reported that the plane was wedged between the trees in such a position that it was almost vertical. [14]\n\nThe bodies were piled on top of one another in the wreck, just 35 miles east of Salt Lake City. It was believed that all died instantly. The pilot's wrist watches had stopped at 1505 hrs. [15]\n\nLloyd Anderson, the flight's pilot, had more than 7,000 hours of flight time. He began flying at Los Angeles and obtained his license in 1926. After completing his flying course he barnstormed and instructed on the west coast and later opened a temporary line between Mexicali, Mazatlan and Mexico City. He flew this route for a time. [16] Anderson also surveyed and opened a mail line between Mazatlan and Brownsville, Texas, and later was with C. A. T., flying between El Paso, Texas, and Mexico City. He surveyed a route between Chihuahua, Mexico, and Nogales, Ariz., and flew this route for two years. [17] Anderson joined United June 15, 1931, as a reserve pilot at Omaha and came to Cheyenne a short time later, flying between Omaha and Salt Lake City. \"[18]\n\nAnderson was 32 years old, was married, and had one son, 3 years old. The company stated that he was born in Canada. [19]\n\nThe co-pilot was Eric G. Danielson, also of Cheyenne, with Miss Mary Carter of Cheyenne, formerly of Omaha and Chattanooga, Tenn., the stewardess and only woman aboard. [20]\n\nDanielson was born in Uppsala, Sweden, and came to the United States as a child. He received his air training in the army, and was stationed at March Field, California, Kelly Field, Texas, and at Fort Crockett, Texas. He completed his student flying in 1931, and later was a pilot in the Texas National Guard. \"He joined the United Air Lines staff July 3, 1933. He was 29 years old. His mother, Mrs. P. J.

{"query": "A Chinese Black Swan that could spook marketsThe number of Americans collecting and applying for unemployment benefits is hovering near pre-pandemic records. By some measures, the figure still exceeds any historical precedent. The volume reflects deep and sustained pain for workers, nearly nine months after the health and economic crisis began. “The numbers we’re looking at now are [far higher than] anything we’ve seen before,” said Erica Groshen, a labor economist at Cornell University and former commissioner of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. “We’ve never seen a shock like this.” Around 5.9 million filed a “continued claim” for state unemployment insurance the week of Nov. 14, according to the Labor Department. Continued claims are a rough proxy for the number of people receiving benefits. Those figures are close to the prior peak — 6.5 million continued claims — set in March 2009 during the Great Recession. (These figures don’t reflect seasonal adjustments, to better compare statistics across time periods.) More from Personal Finance:For  student loan borrowers, monthly payments resume in JanuaryWhat to do before making a charitable donationCongress stalled on stimulus talks as millions face benefits cliff The current level, while down substantially from its pandemic high of nearly 23 million claims in May, is still nearly triple what it was in February. But taking a broader view of unemployment programs shows that the share of people receiving jobless benefits still well exceeds the prior Great Recession record. For example, there are 5 million workers who exhausted their allotment of traditional unemployment insurance and are receiving additional weeks of benefits via separate programs. There are also around 9 million self-employed, gig and other workers currently receiving benefits through the temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. However, some measures, such as PUA, were created as part of the CARES Act federal relief law enacted in March and didn’t exist during prior recessions. Initial claims for jobless benefits are also elevated compared with past decades. There were around 828,000 initial claims for unemployment insurance filed the week of Nov. 21, according to the Labor Department. (Again, this figure doesn’t reflect a seasonal adjustment.) Initial claims are essentially first-time applications for aid. They may also reflect new claims filed by workers laid off for a second time during the pandemic. The current level is down from the peak of 6.2 million initial claims filed in early April, but around four times pre-pandemic levels in February. There are only a few times in history when initial claims peaked above the current level. Workers filed around 1 million initial claims in 1982 and again in 1983; 969,000 claims in 1975; 957,000 in 2009; and 882,000 in 1992. All those exceptionally high levels were set in January, when many temporary workers are laid off after the holiday season, and during or immediately following an economic downturn. In addition, there were another 312,000 workers who filed an initial claim through the PUA program the week of Nov. 21. Overall initial unemployment claims would still exceed those of past decades if such workers were counted.", "label": [{"name": "金融危机", "arguments": {"受影响地区": "Americans"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "August_2016 The Malaysian National Security Council Act comes into effect giving the Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak sweeping new powers. (ABC News PM)PM covers a broad spectrum of issues relevant to all sections of Australia's geographically and culturally diverse community.\nPeter Lloyd reported this story on Monday, August 1, 2016 18:25:00\n\t\t |  A security law has come into force in Malaysia that gives the Prime Minister, Najib Razak, sweeping new powers.As well as letting him declare any area in Malaysia a security zone, the law gives police enhanced powers, including the right to use unlimited force and immunity for their acts. Mr Najib is under international investigation in a billion dollar plus embezzlement scandal.He says the law is needed to combat terrorism. Peter Lloyd reports.PETER LLOYD: Najib Razak rammed the National Security Council Act through Parliament last December. In Malaysia, the country's rotating monarch gives the final signature before a law comes into effect. But the King has been resisting, and, for the first time, a government has gone ahead with legislation without that final step in checks and balance. Linda Lakhdhir is a lawyer from Human Rights Watch.LINDA LAKHDHIR: Once you've declared a national security area, you can do warrantless arrests, you can do warrantless searches for violations of any written law, and that's a part that really, really bothers us. Because it's not that you can do a warrantless search if you think someone's about to commit violence or you think someone is about to, you know, commit a terrorist attack, you can do a warrantless search and a warrantless arrest for suspicion of violating any written law, whether that's the peaceful assembly act, the sedition act, the communications and multimedia act.The laws will be used and abused a lot in Malaysia and that makes it a really, really broad law and it's very concerning to us.PETER LLOYD: Najib Razak's a hard man under pressure, accused of kleptocracy on a grand scale.He's already removed from office an attorney general planning to lay criminal charges, and sacked a potential rival in cabinet who would have replaced him.The new sweeping security laws are fit for an autocrat, precisely what many opposition figures in Malaysia fear is Najib Razak's endgame.Wan Saiful Wan Jan is from the Institute for Democracy. WAN SAIFUL WAN JAN: The problem with this act at the moment is it gives unprecedented amount of power to the hands of one person and that is a worry.PETER LLOYD: Under these security laws, a council led by the PM can impose so called security areas for up to six months at a time.Security forces can search and arrest people, and seize property without a warrant. Officers will be protected from prosecution for any deaths that may occur.In a statement, the Prime Minister defended the laws as necessary, and some of the almost exclusively pro-government media outlets in Malaysia conveyed that message, along with harrowing images of bomb blasts in Baghdad.The only bombshells in Malaysia recently are of the political kind.

{"query": "1964 Rosais earthquakeThe 1964 Rosais earthquake (Portuguese: Crise sísmica dos Rosais) was a series of seismic swarms occurring in February 1964, leading to two major earthquakes on 15 and 21 February, resulting in the destruction of most of the habitable dwellings on the western part of the island of São Jorge, in the archipelago of the Azores. The event resulted in the evacuation of approximately 5,000 residents from that island to Terceira, Pico and Faial. The island of São Jorge is divided into two tectonic regions by tectonic fractures oriented north-northwest to south-southeast, located along an axis between Norte Pequeno and Calheta (the Ribeira Seca fault). [1]\n\nThe northwest portion of the island is the most modern, consisting of basalt and intermediary rock (andesites) of the Rosais Volcanic Complex. [1] This region was also covered swaths of the Manadas complex and debris from the 1580 and 1808 volcanic eruptions. The first eruption (1580) resulted in lava flows in three areas northwest to southeast: along the Ribeira da Almeida, in Queimada (south of Santo Amaro) and between Ribeira do Nabo and the beach of Cruzes (west of Urzelina). [1] The second eruption (1808) resulted in andesite-basaltic lava flows in the southwest of Pico do Pedro, that extended to Urzelina. [1]\n\nThe São Jorge-Pico Channel that separates the islands of Pico and São Jorge is divided by fractures and faults extending north-northwest to south-southwest. [2] The northernmost group of faults on the island of São Jorge extend from Cerrado das Almas to the peak of Loiçano. [2] But, the island is almost bisected by a fault that extends from the promontory of Rosais to just north of Calheta (in the southeast). [2] The Rosais promontory, at a height of 250–400 metres (820–1,310 ft) above sea level, an area dominated by an area of scoria cones, the highest being Monte Trigo at 503 metres (1,650 ft) altitude. [1] A final group of fractures aligned to scoria cones northwest of Velas: to the southeast there are faults towards Pico do Carvão, while to the northeast of Velas are fractures responsible for the submarine eruption in 1964. [2]\n\nSão Jorge has had a history of tectonic movements associated with the submarine fractures between the island and Pico. The most violent of these events occurred on the night of 9 July 1757,[3][4] with its epicenter in Fajã dos Vimes. [2] This event resulted in landslides, opening fractures and resulting in the destruction of dwellings in Manadas (killing one fifth of the population, 1000 people). [2]\n\nThe February 1964 event was a phenomenon related to a submarine volcanic eruption 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) west-northwest of the village of Velas, 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) below sea level. [5]\n\nOn 21 August 1963, tremors were felt in the central group of the Azorean archipelago, including in the epicenter located in the Pico-São Jorge Channel. [5] This event resulted in damage to an area 100 kilometres (62 mi) around Cais do Pico, while the tremors reached an intensity of V-VI on the Mercalli intensity scale affected the parishes of Rosais, Santo Amaro and town of Velas. [5] After 13 December, seismographs in the observatory in Horta registered earthquake swarms linked to a volcanic eruption that continued until January 1964, related initially with Capelinhos. [5] There was a lull after December. On 29 January and 1 February 1964, two submarine cables with the São Jorge Channel were cut. [5] On 14 February volcanic tremors began to be felt, but just as the populace had assumed that the swarm had ended, on 15 February 1964, around 7:00 a.m., the tremors resumed with a violent earthquake (VII-VIII on the Mercalli intensity scale, recorded in the village of Terreiros), that resulted in destruction of homes. [5] Following this earthquake, within the next 24 hours, more than 179 tremors were felt (some reaching VI-VII on the Mercalli intensity scale) and 125 in the following day, before diminishing. [5]\n\nIn the first three days, the epicentre was situated in the middle of São Jorge, in the proximity of historical eruptions in Urzelina and Manadas. [5] In the beginning, the epicenter was located in Pico do Cabeço and Pico de Maria Pires, between Urzelina and Toledo, but later extended to the area of Pico da Esperança. [5] The tremors reached a level VI (Strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing panic and flight of citizenry to the town of Velas: the earthquake affected the areas of Urzelina, Manadas, Santo António and Norte Grande, intensifying until 18 February. [5] On 18 February, the epicenters migrated to the northwest in the direction of the coast of Rosais, with the most intense tremors in the areas of Rosais, Beira, Velas, Santo Amaro, Manadas, Santo António and Norte Grande. [5] A few reached level VIII in Velas and Rosais, where many of the homes were destroyed or became uninhabitable. [5] After 18 February, low intensity earthquake swarms continued in the interior, with the largest hardly felt in Calheta or Topo. [5]\n\nA great number of tremors were noted that anticipated the next earthquake. [5]\n\nOn 21 February, between 5:14 p.m. and 5:25 p.m. three strong earthquakes destroyed the homes in Rosais, and caused damage to dwellings in Toledo, Serroa, Beira and the village of Velas. [5] The shocks attained VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Velas and Rosais, VI (Strong) in Urzelina and Manadas, V (Moderate) in Santo António, Norte Grande, Norte Pequeno and Calheta, and III (Weak) in Topo. The more intense phase terminated on 24 February, at 8:45 p.m. After this event the tremors began to decrease in intensity and frequency, and few were registered in the western part of island. [5] The earthquakes varied: epicenters in the centre of the island were situated approximately 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) in depth; and others, near Velas, were located 10–20 kilometres (6.2–12.4 mi) in depth. Similarly, the more violent tremors were felt in the islands near São Jorge. [5] In total there were more than 500 aftershocks, with the event terminating on 25 February. [5]\n\nAbout 5,000 people abandoned the area affected by the earthquakes, most heading for Calheta; 1000 escaped over the São Jorge-Pico Channel. [5] Coincidentally, after 15 February 1964, a storm had begun, and weather hampered the rescue operations, contributing to a feeling of panic among the populace. [5] With lack of information, the constant tremors and poor weather conditions contributed to a general feeling of impending disaster among the citizenry. [5] The stormy weather continued along the week. As a result of the first days earthquakes, there was significant destruction in the town of Velas and surrounding hamlets. Approximately 400 homes were destroyed, with many of the buildings requiring repairs (about 250 in total). [5] The number of dwellings that were damaged exceeded 900. [5]\n\nLogically, the earthquakes presupposed a submarine volcanic eruption; the smell of sulphur was observed on 18, 19 and 20 February in the town of Velas, and later in Rosais, Beira, Santo Amaro and Norte Grande, and carried on the wind toward the southwest. [5] Yet, the stormy weather made it impossible to see evidence. [5] Meanwhile, a ship crossing the channel observed the presence of white caps on the surface of the water, indicating, possibly that there was a small eruption. [5]\n\nOwing to the general panic and lack of help, 5,000 people were evacuated to the islands of Terceira, Pico and Faial, and were lodged in local homes, in an act of solidarity. The evacuation was extremely troubling, given the persistent storms and waves along the channel between the islands, where waves reached 5 metres (16 ft), and where ships and ports had limited capacity to transport the evacuees. A majority of the evacuees were transported onboard international cargo containers, including specifically the English flag-carrier Remuera, which was travelling within the Azores at the time of the crisis. Lack of planning and excavation equipment, meant that many of the peoples fleeing their homes, leaving the possessions and abandoning their domestic animals.", "label": [{"name": "地震", "arguments": {"震中": "middle of São Jorge", "受影响地区": "the western part of the island of São Jorge, in the archipelago of the Azores", "被毁建筑数量": "400 homes were destroyed", "疏散人数": "5,000 residents", "日期": "February 1964", "余震次数": "more than 500 aftershocks"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "‘Droughts Don’t Cause Water Scarcity — People Do’: Experts Say Utah Needs To Permanently Reduce Water UseUtah is in the midst of its worst drought in decades. While state officials have focused on it to explain the water shortage Utah is facing, experts say there’s more to the story. Brian Richter owns a consulting firm called Sustainable Waters. He said droughts don’t cause water scarcity — people do. Richter said states in the Colorado River Basin, like Utah, are already using too much water based on the river’s average annual output. “We really need to take stock of how much water we’re using and what we’re using it for, and start a conversation about whether or not there are things we can do to lessen our dependence on those water supplies,” he said. Consumption exceeds the Colorado River’s annual flow most years, so suppliers pull water out of reservoirs like Lake Powell and Lake Mead to make up the difference. But that won’t work forever. In order to reduce Utah’s overall use and ward off future water shortages, state lawmakers need to step up, according to Zach Frankel with the Utah Rivers Council. He said one thing elected officials could do to help is force water suppliers to increase tiered rates across the state. Right now, Utahns pay some of the lowest rates in the West, according to Frankel. A 2010 analysis by the Utah Division of Water Resources found the average water rate in Utah was $1.34 per gallon. Only Idaho’s was lower, at $1.26. Meanwhile, Utahns use the highest amount of public supply water — meaning it’s delivered by a supplier like a city or service district. “When we make water really cheap, we make water use really high,” Frankel said. “It’s just consumer behavior.” The best way to increase rates, according to Frankel, is by bumping the price per gallon up significantly after a customer’s use passes a certain threshold. That way, costs only go up for high-use consumers. Frankel said water rates in Utah are also heavily subsidized by property taxes. His organization has tried to pass legislation to change that, but he said water service districts in Utah opposed the move. “If they raise the cost of water, they sell less water, then they’ll make less money,” he said. “They’re water salesmen at some level.” He said state lawmakers could also invest in infrastructure to stop agricultural water waste, like lining irrigation canals, rather than building expensive pipeline projects to move more water out of reservoirs.", "label": [{"name": "干旱", "arguments": {"受影响地区": "Utah", "原因": "the water shortage", "日期": "decades", "相关的河流或湖泊": "Lake Powell and Lake Mead"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "July_2016 Germany's parliament passes a new law saying that it is rape to have sex with a person who says \"No\" to the sex. Under the previous law, sex was not considered rape unless the victim fought back. The new law also classifies groping as a sex crime, makes it easier to deport migrants who commit sex offences, and makes it easier to prosecute assaults committed by a large group. (BBC)Germany's parliament has passed a new law defining rape, clarifying that \"No means No\", even if a victim did not fight back.\nCritics believe Germany has long lagged behind other developed nations when it comes to its rape laws.\nThe issue was again brought to the fore after a number of sex attacks on women in Cologne on New Year's Eve.\nThe vote was passed by a huge majority on Thursday in the Bundestag, where MPs stood and cheered the result.\nThe new law classifies groping as a sex crime and makes it easier to prosecute assaults committed by large group.\nIt also makes it easier to deport migrants who commit sex offences.\nUnder the previous law, defined in Section 177 of the criminal code (in German), victims should have defended themselves for an act to constitute rape. Simply saying \"No\" was not sufficient to find the defendant guilty, and there was no attempt to define what constituted consent.\nThe inadequacy of the law meant many perpetrators got away with rape, according to a 2014 study of 107 cases by the German association of women's counselling centres and rape crisis centres (BFF).\nThe authors said that in every case, sexual assaults had been committed against the victim's unambiguous will, which had been communicated verbally to the perpetrator.  However, they said, either charges were not filed or there was no court conviction.\nThe study went on to note that the law placed too much focus on whether the victim resisted and did not reflect real-life scenarios in which people were raped.\nOnly one in 10 rapes is reported in Germany currently, according to Germany's n-tv news website. And of those, the conviction rate is only 10%.\n\"In the past there were cases where women were raped but the perpetrators couldn't be punished,'' Minister for Women Manuela Schwesig said.\n\"The change in the law will help increase the number of victims who choose to press charges, lower the number of criminal prosecutions that are shelved and ensure sexual assaults are properly punished.\"\nThey will take into account both physical and verbal cues from the victim when assessing whether rape took place, meaning, in theory, that saying \"No\" could prove a lack of consent and, therefore, rape.\nGermany has long been backward when it comes to its rape laws, say campaigners - pointing out that marital rape became a criminal offence only in 1997.\nA number of prominent cases have pushed the issue into the spotlight.\nThe wave of attacks on New Year's Eve in Cologne shocked Germans, though prosecutions have been minimal and many were aghast to learn that, once again, assault could only be proven under German law if the victim resisted. On Thursday, a 21-year-old Iraqi and an Algerian of 26 became the first men to be convicted of sexual assault when a Cologne court gave them suspended one-year sentences.\nThe attacks prompted a campaign for reform under the hashtag \"NeinHeisstNein\" (No means No).\nCologne sex attacks: MPs debate tougher laws\nAnd, in a case that has sparked an outcry in Germany, two men were acquitted of drugging and raping German model Gina-Lisa Lohfink - despite having uploaded a video of what took place, in which she was reportedly heard saying, \"Stop it, stop it\" and \"No\".\nNot only were the men cleared of wrongdoing, but Ms Lohfink was fined €24,000 (£21,000; $27,000) for falsely testifying.\nShe has appealed against the the charges. The case has been compared to the Stanford University sexual assault furore in the United States.\nCampaigners say the new law is a good start, but does not go far enough.\nThey have expressed concern that the law will not give adequate protection to victims who cannot clearly convey their lack of consent - such as those who have been drugged.\nThere are also plans to tighten the law governing sexual harassment and group assaults.\nActivist Kristina Lunz said it was unacceptable that the vast majority of rapes were still going unpunished in Germany.\n\"Of course it should be 'Yes means Yes',\" says Ms Lunz, referring to a 2015 law passed in California that makes the legal standard for sex affirmative verbal consent.\n\n", "label": [{"name": "政府政策变更", "arguments": {"审议机构": "Germany's parliament", "政策内容": "defining rape, clarifying that \"No means No\", even if a victim did not fight back", "地点": "Germany", "宣布日期": "Thursday", "原因": "ensure sexual assaults are properly punished"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

Jenna Gallegos via Twitter Pack up the tent, Bonnaroo faithful. The Manchester, Tenn. music festival isn't happening this weekend.  Organizers of Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival canceled the four-night event due to intense rainfall from Tropical Depression Ida.  Rain moved in late Monday and continued throughout Tuesday, causing saturated tollbooth paths and flooded campgrounds \"to the point that we are unable to drive in or park vehicles safely,\" according to a statement from Bonnaroo.  \"We are absolutely heartbroken to announce that we must cancel Bonnaroo,\" the festival said Tuesday via Twitter. \"While this weekend’s weather looks outstanding, currently Centeroo is waterlogged in many areas.\" The statement continued, \"We have done everything in our power to try to keep the show moving forward, but [mother nature] has dealt us a tremendous amount of rain over the past 24 hours, and we have run out of options to try to make the event happen safely and in a way that lives up to the Bonnaroo experience.\"  Bonnaroo takes place in Manchester, Tennessee, about 70 miles south of Nashville. A flash flood warning remains in effect for Coffee County until 1 a.m. The region expected to get three to six inches of rain from the remnants of Ida.  'UTTER pain': Festival-goers distressed after Bonnaroo gets canceled, but some find other plans Sam Herron, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Nashville, said Tuesday that just under three inches of rain had fallen around the Manchester area. “Of course it’s still raining down there, so probably another quarter inch of rain is expected to fall into the evening,” Herron said. This is the second consecutive Bonnaroo to be canceled. 2020’s fest was pushed back three months due to the coronavirus pandemic, then ultimately canceled. When Bonnaroo unveiled plans for a return in 2021, it was for September — marking the first time the festival has ever been scheduled outside of June.  Tickets to 2021 Bonnaroo sold out three weeks after on-sale; headliners for the now-axed event included Foo Fighters, Lizzo, Megan Thee Stallion and Tyler, The Creator.  Bonnaroo's post says all tickets purchased through Front Gate Tickets (i.e. directly through the festival) will be refunded \"in as little as 30 days to the original method of payment.\" 'Not something we expected to be possible' While the cancellation came as a shock to many, there were warning signs starting on Sunday, when Bonnaroo announced it would delay its campground opening by a day due to conditions. On Monday, they reported that areas of the campground were rendered \"unusable,\" and offered refunds to all ticket holders.  As the majority of its audience comes to Bonnaroo from outside of Tennessee (and 55% from beyond the southeast, according to a 2018 poll), Tuesday's announcement wasn't enough notice for some.  2021 ticket-holder Josh Petefish got word after driving eight hours with a traveling party of seven people that organizers cancelled Bonnaroo. He planned to join a camping group of 16, including travelers from New York, Minnesota and Colorado, – on The Farm. Petefish plans to regroup Tuesday night in Nashville, he said. He initially bought tickets for this weekend’s event in 2019. “We had some expectations that things wouldn’t be quite the same,” said Petefish, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa. “Maybe they would cut people off on a certain day ... being totally canceled is not something we expected to be possible.” He added, “Since we have all this camping gear we’ll find somewhere near here [to camp]. Any recommendations?”  'Safe and smart' The cancellation even came as a surprise to those who'd been working on the grounds ahead of the festival — like Jenna Gallegos of Wichita, Kan. 2021 is her fourth year working at Bonnaroo as a volunteer. Her compensation? Free meals and admission to the (now-canceled) festival.  Gallegos said work, including construction of festival areas, was continuing throughout Tuesday. \"Everybody's really heartbroken,\" she said. \"Honestly, it came very abruptly. My crew, we were literally working, and then Bonnaroo tweeted out that they canceled and didn't really tell anybody other than that. So we're very shocked. I mean, I feel like people are trying to stay in high spirits just because they're already here.\" Disappointment and sympathy was expressed by performers like Jason Isbell, who was set to return to the festival this weekend.  \"I’m sorry y’all had to make this choice but I believe it was the right one,\" he wrote on Twitter.  \"I was really REALLY looking forward to it, but ya gotta be safe and smart. Love to everybody on the crew with a broken heart today.\" \"Was really looking forward to my first Roo performance but this hurricane is no joke,\" tweeted Nashville rapper Daisha McBride. \"Sending love to everyone in its path.\" Bonnaroo ended Tuesday's announcement with a familiar refrain — confidently asserting their return next year. \"Please find ways to safely gather with your Bonnaroo community and continue to radiate positivity during this disappointing time.

(Reuters)NEW YORK (Reuters) - An executive of a California research firm was arrested on Wednesday on securities fraud and conspiracy charges after U.S. prosecutors accused him of arranging for inside information to be leaked to hedge funds, the latest development in an investigation of the industry.\nThe arrest of Don Ching Trang Chu of Primary Global Research stems from wiretaps and the cooperation of Richard Choo-Beng Lee, a hedge fund manager who pleaded guilty last year as part of the insider-trading prosecution of Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and 22 other traders, lawyers and executives.\nChu, 56, also known as Don Chu, was accused in a criminal complaint in U.S. District Court in New York of introducing hedge funds to corporate executives who gave them insider trading information.\nThe government scored a victory in the Galleon case on Wednesday when a judge ruled that telephone conversations of Rajaratnam’s that were secretly recorded by the FBI were admissible as evidence at his trial. Rajaratnam has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and securities fraud and is scheduled to go on trial on January 17.\nProsecutors have described the Galleon case as the biggest investigation of insider trading at hedge funds in the United States. The investigation has widened to include subpoenas of several funds with billions of dollars under management.\nIn subpoenas served on SAC Capital Advisors and other hedge funds and mutual funds, authorities have asked for information about so-called “soft dollar” deals, an arrangement in which a hedge fund client executes trades through a designated brokerage that has some relationship with an expert networking firm such as Primary Global.\nExpert networking firms take fees to match up hedge funds with experts in particular industries such as medicine, engineering and technology.\nThe investigation widened on Monday when FBI agents used search warrants to raid three hedge funds in Connecticut and Massachusetts.\nLee once worked for SAC Capital. There is nothing in Wednesday’s complaint accusing SAC Capital of any wrongdoing. A spokesman for SAC declined to comment.\nAuthorities are looking at funds established by former associates of SAC founder Steven Cohen, according to lawyers and people familiar with the investigation.\nA spokesman for Primary Global Research said in a statement that “based upon recent events, PGR has severed its relationship with Mr. Chu.”\nThe statement said Chu served as the firm’s liaison in Taiwan and that he had been with PGR for seven years.\nRelated Coverage\nChu, of Somerset, New Jersey, made a brief appearance before a magistrate judge in New York and was released on a bond of $1 million. Chu was not asked to enter a plea to the charges and both of his lawyers declined to comment.\nThe office of Manhattan federal prosecutor Preet Bharara said Chu had been scheduled to leave the United States for Taiwan on November 28. His lawyers said Chu had planned the trip to visit family.

{"query": "October_2009 Mayoral, regional and district council elections take place in Moscow and 75 other regions across Russia. (RIA Novosti) (The Guardian) (BBC)Opposition parties in Russia have alleged that local elections across the country were marred by fraud.\nMayoral, regional and district council votes were held across Russia on Sunday, with some 30 million people eligible to vote. Official results showed PM Vladimir Putin's United Russia party winning nearly every poll by a wide margin. But opposition parties say they were refused registration to take part and were denied media access. Votes were held in almost all regions, including Chechnya and Ingushetia. 'Loyalty'\nAs results came in on Monday, United Russia claimed victory after victory. In the vote for Moscow City Council, election officials said United Russia won 66% and the Communists 13%. Those figures were expected to give the ruling party all but three of the 35 seats in the Moscow parliament, strengthening the hand of Moscow's powerful mayor, Yuri Luzhkov. The opposition liberal Yabloko party failed to win 5%, losing its place on the council. The results, echoed across the country, wiped out opposition hopes that it could capitalise on the serious economic crisis in Russia, amid sharp negative growth and rising unemployment. Instead, that inspired loyalty to United Russia, according to senior party official Boris Gryzlov. \"We can say that the voters and people of Russia, in a situation when we are fighting the global economic crisis, when we are struggling to stabilise the political situation, are with the party of power,\" he said. 'Votes taken'\nVladimir Churov, chairman of Russia's Central Election Commission, praised the electoral process. \"The elections were recognised [as] valid and were well organised, with a quite high turnout,\" he told Itar-Tass. However, concerns over the polling led to one opposition leader, former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, calling on voters to boycott the elections or spoil their ballots. \"These elections are illegitimate. They're nothing but a farce,\" he told the Associated Press. Mr Nemtsov was refused permission to stand in Moscow's city council election, AP reported, with election officials alleging the 5,000 signatures his party collected were forged. Another opposition party, Yabloko, also alleged irregularities in Moscow, saying voters had contacted party officials to say they tried to vote but found votes already cast in their names. Party observers also noticed large numbers of voters at a polling station who did not live in that voting area, Yabloko said, adding that it was preparing a complaint to election officials.", "label": [{"name": "选举", "arguments": {"地点": "Russia", "最终票数及百分比": "United Russia won 66% and the Communists 13", "日期": "Sunday", "投票结果（谁赢谁输）": "PM Vladimir Putin's United Russia party winning nearly every poll by a wide margin", "最终席位结果": "three of the 35 seats", "投票方式": "polling station"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "Colwich rail crash\n\nThe Colwich rail crash occurred on the evening of Friday 19 September 1986 at Colwich Junction, Staffordshire, England. [1]  It was significant in that it was a high speed collision between two packed express trains. One driver was killed, but no passengers died because of the great strength of the rolling stock involved, which included examples of Mk1, Mk2 and Mk3 coaches. Colwich Junction lies between Rugeley and Stafford and is where the four-track West Coast Main Line from London splits into two routes. Approaching from the south, two tracks go to Manchester via Stoke-on-Trent and two tracks go to Stafford and Crewe. In the middle of the layout, two of the lines cross each other at a diamond crossing. In August 1986, the signalling was altered so that drivers of northbound trains taking the Stoke line would see flashing yellow signals on approach. The rulebook meaning of this was:\n\n\"A flashing yellow aspect means facing points at a junction ahead are set for a diverging route and the speed of the train must be reduced\". [2]\n\nThis sequence of signalling was designed for use at higher-speed turnouts as a replacement for approach release, where the junction signal is held at red until the train is near to it. Over the next few years, flashing yellows were also installed at locations where trains cross over between different tracks travelling in the same direction, e.g. from a \"fast\" line to a \"slow\" line. While not \"junctions\" in the traditional sense, the signalling sequence was identical to that given at a \"diverging\" route. On 19 September 1986, the signalman at Colwich saw that the 17:00 express train from London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly was approaching the junction at roughly the same time as the 17:20 express from Liverpool to Euston. He decided to give precedence to the latter and so the Manchester train might need to wait its turn over the junction. The Manchester train needed to cross from the Down Fast to the Down Slow line before turning off towards Stoke. The signals presented to its driver were as follows:\n\nAfter passing over the crossover he saw that CH23 was still red. Having interpreted the flashing yellows to mean that the route was set all the way over the junction to Stoke, he was expecting this signal to clear as he approached it (as under the approach release system). But as he got nearer he realised it had not. The driver made an emergency brake application but the train did not stop before reaching the diamond crossing. At that moment he saw the Liverpool train approaching at high speed and shouted a warning to a trainee driver who was also in the cab. They both jumped from the locomotive almost immediately before the Liverpool train collided with it. The locomotive of the Liverpool train was 86211 City of Milton Keynes. It hit the other locomotive 86429 The Times side-on, which finished up in the wreckage with its body twisted and split open. The passenger coaches were scattered in all directions and some had their ends badly damaged. Eric Goode, the driver of no. 86211, was killed. [3]  It was also reported that Nicaragua's ambassador to Britain, Francisco d'Escoto, was one of the injured passengers. [4]\n\nAfter the accident, the driver went to the signal box and told the signalman \"You had double flashing yellows and the route was set for Stoke\". [5][6]  With \"traditional\" junction layouts in mind, flashing yellows would have meant that the route was set for him right through the junction, with at worst, the red signal on the far side. It was not; at Colwich the signalling system was designed for the 'diverging route' to be only the crossover from the Down Fast to the Down Slow, and the driver was not expecting to see a red signal before taking the Stoke line. In this respect railway nomenclature had unwittingly set a trap; he had after all seen a 'Junction Indicator' illuminated and thus assumed that his train had been routed across the junction. [7]\n\nThe public inquiry centred on whether the driver had had adequate training on the recently introduced flashing yellow signals and the implications at multiple junctions (Hall 1987). The driver admitting to signing for, but not actually reading, the Notice that referred to the installation of flashing yellows at Colwich the previous month. A contributory factor was the lack of flank protection given the layout at Colwich Junction. The accident would not have happened if the points had been set to route the train away from the diamond crossing, rather than head-on into the Liverpool train's path, as would have been normal practice in an older manual installation. This feature was not included in the junction design because it would have prevented a parallel movement from being signalled on the down fast line,[8] even though in this particular case the train had approached on the down fast line anyway. This lesson was not learnt; lack of flank protection would again prove a significant factor in a head-on collision, at the Ladbroke Grove rail crash in 1999 (Hall 2003). The Inspector's report recommended changing the signalling system so that a flashing yellow sequence could only occur when the route was set across the whole junction, as the driver was expecting. [note 1] A second recommendation was to inhibit wheel slide protection (WSP) during an emergency brake application – practical tests suggested the train could then have stopped before fouling the junction. The latter recommendation was not implemented. Local resident Alf Taylor created a memorial to Eric Goode at the site of the accident, which he looked after until his death in 1997. On 17 September 2006, the Sunday before the 20th anniversary of the accident, the garden was re-dedicated.

(BBC)The Philippine government has reached a framework peace agreement with the country's largest Muslim rebel group, President Benigno Aquino says.\nThe deal follows long negotiations with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to end a 40-year conflict that has cost more than 120,000 lives.\nIt provides for a new autonomous region in the south, where Muslims are a majority in a mainly Catholic country.\nThe MILF is \"very happy\" with the deal, a spokesman was quoted as saying. The agreement was reached after talks in Malaysia and is expected to be signed formally on 15 October in the Philippine capital, Manila. A copy of the framework deal says the parties commit to reaching a \"comprehensive deal\" by the end of the year. \"This framework agreement paves the way for a final and enduring peace in Mindanao,\" President Aquino said in a speech to announce the deal, referring to the main southern region.\nBut he added: \"The work does not end here. There are still details that both sides must hammer out.\" Correspondents say the agreement marks a major breakthrough, though previous peace efforts have broken down and negotiations with the MILF over the last 15 years were interrupted by violence.\nThe Philippine government's chief negotiator Marvic Leonen told the BBC that the new peace deal has more political support than previous agreements, after the negotiation panel held more than 100 consultations with Muslims, Christians, and local and regional governments.\nThe MILF's vice chairman for political affairs Ghazali Jaafar told AFP news agency: \"We are very happy. We thank the president for this.\" It is hoped that the agreement could be implemented on the ground by the end of President Aquino's term in 2016.\n'Casting aside distrust'\nPresident Aquino said the new autonomous region would be named Bangsamoro, after the Moros living there. \"This framework agreement is about rising above our prejudices,\" the president said. \"It is about casting aside the distrust and myopia that has the plagued efforts of the past.\"\nSunday's agreement provides for the creation of a \"transition commission\" tasked with drafting a law to implement the framework deal.\nThe draft agreement would give the leaders of the Bangsamoro more political and economic powers, promises the people a \"just and equitable share\" of the region's abundant natural resources, and pledges to address the needs of poverty-stricken communities.\nIt also provides for the MILF to \"undertake a graduated program for decommissioning of its forces\" and says both sides would work for  \"reduction and control of firearms and the disbandment of private armies and other armed groups\". Law enforcement would be transferred from the army to the Bangsamoro police in a \"phased and gradual manner\".  The MILF, created after a split with another rebel group in 1977, had earlier dropped its demand for an independent Muslim state.\nPresident Aquino acknowledged on Sunday that the current autonomous region in the same area, created in 1989, had been a \"failed experiment\". Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose country has brokered peace talks since 2001, said he was \"delighted\" at the \"historic deal\". \"The rights, dignity and future prosperity of the Bangsamoro people will be protected, while at the same time the sovereignty and constitution of the Philippines will be preserved,\" he said.\nThe Philippines is made up of more than 7,000 islands, with a population of about 95 million. It has faced separatist movements in Mindanao, where the MILF is based, and in Jolo, home to the radical Islamist Abu Sayyaf group, which is reputedly linked to al-Qaeda.\nCommunist rebels have also waged a guerrilla over much of the country from 1969. \n", "label": [{"name": "签署协议", "arguments": {"缔约成员大会（合同当事人）": "the country's largest Muslim rebel group", "协议内容": "end a 40-year conflict", "日期": "15 October", "地点": "Manila"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

It is suspected that at least twenty other people have been killed in the attack. (Al Jazeera)Regional authorities accuse Oromo Liberation Army of carrying out the attack, with reports putting the death toll at ‘several dozen’.\nArmed men in western Ethiopia have rounded up and executed dozens of men, women and children, in a “brutal” attack officials blamed on an armed group that is active in the region.\nAccording to Amnesty International, Sunday’s attack on Gawa Qanqa village in Guliso District of West Wellega Zone took place a day after government forces unexpectedly left the area.\nThe exact death toll was not yet known. Amnesty, citing survivors, said on Monday at least 54 members of the Amhara ethnic group  Ethiopia’s second-largest  were killed. Earlier, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said in a statement the official death toll stood at 32 people but the actual number could be much higher.\nThe commission said the victims “were dragged from their homes and taken to a school, where they were killed”, in a “massacre” that involved up to 60 “armed and unarmed assailants”.\nThere has been no claim of responsibility, but the Oromia regional government said the attackers belonged to the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), an armed group blamed for kidnappings and bomb attacks in western and southern Ethiopia.\nSurvivors of the attack who spoke to the Amhara region’s affiliated broadcaster, Amhara Mass Media Agency, said ethnic Amharas were targeted.\n“The armed group gathered 200 people for a meeting around 5pm, and then started shooting at them. Several people were killed as a result,” the broadcaster quoted one survivor as saying. The survivor said a school and some 120 houses were burned.\nA survivor who spoke by phone to AFP news agency also said the violence erupted after soldiers stationed in the area abruptly and inexplicably left, allowing OLA fighters to round up civilians.\n“After collecting us, they opened fire on us, and then afterwards looted cattle and burned down houses,” said the survivor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for safety reasons.\n“I have counted more than 50 corpses, and I know there were others hit by bullets,” the survivor said.\nThe OLA, believed to number in the low thousands, broke off from the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), an opposition party that spent years in exile but was allowed to return to Ethiopia after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018.\nSince December 2018, the Ethiopian army has been deployed in western and southern Oromia to combat the OLA’s armed campaign.\nAbiy on Monday condemned the “heartbreaking” attack, saying he had deployed security forces to the area.\n“Ethiopia’s enemies are vowing either to rule the country or ruin it, and they are doing everything they can to achieve this. One of their tactics is to arm civilians and carry out barbaric attacks based on identity,” Abiy said in a statement.\nThe incident is likely to further ramp up pressure on Abiy, winner of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, to improve security in a country struggling with rising ethnic violence.\nDeprose Muchena, Amnesty’s regional director for East and Southern Africa, said the “senseless” attack was “the latest in a series of killings in the country in which members of ethnic minorities have been deliberately targeted”.\n“The fact that this horrendous incident occurred shortly after government troops abruptly withdrew from the area in unexplained circumstances raises questions that must be answered,” he added, calling for an investigation.\nThe EHRC also urged authorities to probe why the military withdrew from the area.\n“These gruesome killings of civilians are unconscionable and flout basic principles of humanity,” said Daniel Bekele, the head of the commission. “No amount of grievance can justify such brutality and perpetrators should be held to account.”\nThe National Movement of Amhara (NAMA), an opposition party, denounced the government over its failure to protect civilians.\n“The government has failed in its duty to protect the safety of citizens,” Dessalegn Chanie, a senior member of NAMA, told The Associated Press news agency, adding that Ethiopia’s language-based federal system is the main cause for the killings.\n“Ethnic Amharas residing outside of the Amhara region are being labelled as outsiders and are exposed to repeated attacks.”\n", "label": [{"name": "武装冲突", "arguments": {"受损设施": "a school and some 120 houses were burned", "攻击者": "Oromo Liberation Army", "人员伤亡": "at least 54 members of the Amhara ethnic group  Ethiopia’s second-largest  were killed", "地点": "Gawa Qanqa village in Guliso District of West Wellega Zone", "日期": "around 5pm"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

{"query": "The coronavirus is here to stay — here’s what that means Children in Copenhagen play during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Endemic viruses are often first encountered in childhood. Credit: Liselotte Sabroe/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty You have full access to this article via your institution. For much of the past year, life in Western Australia has been coronavirus-free. Friends gathered in pubs; people kissed and hugged their relatives; children went to school without temperature checks or wearing masks. The state maintained this enviable position only by placing heavy restrictions on travel and imposing lockdowns — some regions entered a snap lockdown at the beginning of the year after a security guard at a hotel where visitors were quarantined tested positive for the virus. But the experience in Western Australia has provided a glimpse into a life free from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. If other regions, aided by vaccines, aimed for a similar zero-COVID strategy, then could the world hope to rid itself of the virus? It’s a beautiful dream but most scientists think it’s improbable. In January, Nature asked more than 100 immunologists, infectious-disease researchers and virologists working on the coronavirus whether it could be eradicated. Almost 90% of respondents think that the coronavirus will become endemic — meaning that it will continue to circulate in pockets of the global population for years to come (see 'Endemic future'). Source: Nature survey “Eradicating this virus right now from the world is a lot like trying to plan the construction of a stepping-stone pathway to the Moon. It’s unrealistic,” says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. But failure to eradicate the virus does not mean that death, illness or social isolation will continue on the scales seen so far. The future will depend heavily on the type of immunity people acquire through infection or vaccination and how the virus evolves. Influenza and the four human coronaviruses that cause common colds are also endemic: but a combination of annual vaccines and acquired immunity means that societies tolerate the seasonal deaths and illnesses they bring without requiring lockdowns, masks and social distancing. More than one-third of the respondents to Nature’s survey thought that it would be possible to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 from some regions while it continued to circulate in others. In zero-COVID regions there would be a continual risk of disease outbreaks, but they could be quenched quickly by herd immunity if most people had been vaccinated. “I guess COVID will be eliminated from some countries, but with a continuing (and maybe seasonal) risk of reintroduction from places where vaccine coverage and public-health measures have not been good enough,” says Christopher Dye, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, UK. “The virus becoming endemic is likely, but the pattern that it will take is hard to predict,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist from Georgetown University, who is based in Seattle, Washington. This will determine the societal costs of SARS-CoV-2 for 5, 10 or even 50 years in the future (see ‘Coronavirus: here to stay?’). Five years from now, when childcare centres call parents to tell them that their child has a runny nose and a fever, the COVID-19 pandemic might seem a distant memory. But there’s a chance the virus that killed more than 1.5 million people in 2020 alone will be the culprit. This is one scenario that scientists foresee for SARS-CoV-2. The virus sticks around, but once people develop some immunity to it — either through natural infection or vaccination — they won’t come down with severe symptoms. The virus would become a foe first encountered in early childhood, when it typically causes mild infection or none at all, says Jennie Lavine, an infectious-disease researcher at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Scientists consider this possible because that’s how the four endemic coronaviruses, called OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1, behave. At least three of these viruses have probably been circulating in human populations for hundreds of years; two of them are responsible for roughly 15% of respiratory infections. Using data from previous studies, Lavine and her colleagues developed a model that shows how most children first come down with these viruses before the age of 6 and develop immunity to them1. That defence wanes pretty quickly so it is not sufficient to block reinfection entirely, but it seems to protect adults from getting sick, says Lavine. Even in children, the first infection is relatively mild. How ‘killer’ T cells could boost COVID immunity in face of new variants Whether immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will behave in the same way is so far unclear. A large study of people who have had COVID-19 suggests that their levels of neutralizing antibodies — which help to block reinfection — start to decline after around six to eight months2. But their bodies also make memory B cells, which can manufacture antibodies if a new infection arises, and T cells that can eliminate virus-infected cells, says Daniela Weiskopf, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California, who co-authored the study. It’s yet to be established if this immune memory can block viral reinfection — although cases of reinfection have been recorded, and new viral variants might make them more likely, they are still considered rare. Weiskopf and her colleagues are still tracking the immune memory of people infected with COVID-19 to see if it persists. If most people develop life-long immunity to the virus, either through natural infection or vaccination, then the virus is unlikely to become endemic, she says. But immunity might wane after a year or two — and already there are hints that the virus can evolve to escape it. More than half the scientists who responded to Nature’s survey think waning immunity will be one of the main drivers of the virus becoming endemic. Because the virus has spread around the world, it might seem that it could already be classed as endemic. But because infections continue to increase worldwide, and with so many people still susceptible, scientists still technically class it as in a pandemic phase. In the endemic phase, the number of infections becomes relatively constant across years, allowing for occasional flare-ups, says Lavine. To reach this steady state could take a few years or decades, depending on how quickly populations develop immunity, says Lavine. Allowing the virus to spread unchecked would be the fastest way to get to that point — but that would result in many millions of deaths. “That path has some huge costs,” she says. The most palatable path is through vaccination. Countries that have begun distributing COVID-19 vaccines soon expect to see a reduction in severe illness. But it will take longer to see how effectively vaccines can reduce transmission. Data from clinical trials suggest that vaccines that prevent symptomatic infection might also stop a person from passing on the virus. The latest COVID research updates If vaccines do block transmission — and if they remain effective against newer variants of the virus — it might be possible to eliminate the virus in regions where enough people are vaccinated so that they can protect those who are not, contributing to herd immunity. A vaccine that is 90% effective at blocking transmission will need to reach at least 55% of the population to achieve temporary herd immunity as long as some social distancing measures — such as face masks and many people working from home — remain in place to keep transmission in check, according to a model3 developed by Alexandra Hogan at Imperial College London and her colleagues. (A vaccine would need to reach almost 67% of people to provide herd immunity if all social distancing measures were lifted.) But if the rate of transmission increases because of a new variant, or if a vaccine is less effective than 90% at blocking transmission, vaccine coverage will need to be greater to blunt circulation. Vaccinating even 55% of the population will be challenging in many countries. “The virus will stick around if parts of the world don’t get vaccinated,” says Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious-disease researcher at Columbia University in New York City. Even if the virus remains endemic in many regions, global travel will probably resume when severe infections are reduced to levels that health services can cope with, and when a high proportion of people who are vulnerable to severe illness have been vaccinated, says Dye. The 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed more than 50 million people, is the yardstick by which all other pandemics are measured. It was sparked by a type of virus known as influenza A, which originated in birds. Almost all cases of influenza A since then, and all subsequent flu pandemics, have been caused by descendants of the 1918 virus. These descendants circulate the globe, infecting millions of people each year. Flu pandemics occur when populations are naive to a virus; by the time a pandemic virus becomes seasonal, much of the population has some immunity to it. Seasonal flu still has a significant toll globally, claiming roughly 650,000 lives per year.

Shaman and others say the virus could also settle into a seasonal pattern of annual winter outbreaks similar to flu. Flu seems to evolve much faster than SARS-CoV-2, allowing it to sneak past the immune system’s defences. This feature is why flu vaccines need to be reformulated each year; that might not be needed for SARS-CoV-2. Still, the coronavirus might be able to dodge immunity acquired by infection, and possibly outsmart vaccines. Already, laboratory studies show that neutralizing antibodies in the blood of people who have had COVID-19 are less capable of recognizing a viral variant first identified in South Africa (called 501Y.V2), than variants that circulated earlier in the pandemic4. That is probably because of mutations in the virus’s spike protein, which vaccines target. Trial results suggest that some vaccines might be less effective against 501Y.V2 than against other variants, and some vaccine makers are exploring redesigns of their products. Still, the immune system has lots of tricks up its sleeve, and can respond to many features of the virus, not just spike, says Lavine. “The virus is probably going to have to go through lots of mutations to make a vaccine ineffective,” she says. Preliminary trial results also suggest that vaccines can protect people with 501Y.V2 against severe disease, says Rasmussen. More than 70% of the researchers surveyed by Nature think that immune escape will be another driver of the virus’s continuing circulation (see 'Driving factors'). This would not be a first for a human coronavirus. In a study5 yet to be peer reviewed, Bloom and his colleagues show that the endemic coronavirus 229E has evolved so that neutralizing antibodies in the blood of people infected with the viral variant circulating in the late 1980s and early 1990s are much less effective against more recent variants. People are reinfected with 229E over their lifetime, and Bloom suspects that it might be harder to stave off the variants that have evolved to escape previous immunity. But scientists don’t know whether these reinfections are associated with worse symptoms. “I would expect that over many years, accumulated mutations to SARS-CoV-2 will more completely erode neutralizing antibody immunity as we saw for CoV-229E, although I can’t say for sure how the rates will compare among the two coronaviruses,” says Bloom. Source: Nature survey Bloom thinks it’s probable that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will need to be updated, possibly every year. But even then, immunity from either past vaccination or infection will probably blunt serious disease, he says. And Lavine notes that even if people are reinfected, this might not be a big deal. With the endemic coronaviruses, frequent reinfections seem to boost immunity against related variants and typically people experience only mild symptoms, she says. But it is possible that vaccines won’t stop some people developing severe symptoms, in which case the virus will continue to be a significant burden on society, says Shaman. If SARS-CoV-2 vaccines block infection and transmission for life, the virus might become something akin to measles. “It’s probably less likely [than other scenarios] but it’s still possible,” says Shaman. How to redesign COVID vaccines so they protect against variants With a highly effective measles vaccine — two doses and a person is protected for life — the measles virus has been eliminated in many parts of the world. Before a vaccine was developed in 1963, major epidemics killed about 2.6 million people, mostly children, a year. Unlike flu vaccines, the immunization for measles has never needed to be updated because the virus has yet to evolve in ways that evade the immune system. Measles is still endemic in parts of the world with insufficient immunization. In 2018, a global resurgence killed more than 140,000 people. A similar situation could emerge with SARS-CoV-2 if people decline vaccines. A survey of more than 1,600 US citizens found that more than one-quarter would definitely or probably decline a COVID-19 vaccine, even if it were free and deemed safe (see go.nature.com/3a9b44s). “How successful we are at addressing those concerns will determine how many people get the vaccine and how many remain susceptible,” says Rasmussen. The future of SARS-CoV-2 will also depend on whether it establishes itself in a wild animal population. Several diseases brought under control persist because animal reservoirs, such as insects, provide chances for pathogens to spill back into people. These include yellow fever, Ebola and chikungunya virus. SARS-CoV-2 probably originated in bats, but it might have passed to people through an intermediate host. The virus can readily infect many animals, including cats, rabbits and hamsters. It is particularly infectious in mink, and mass outbreaks on mink farms in Denmark and the Netherlands have led to huge animal culls. The virus has also passed between minks and people. If it became established in a wild-animal population and could spill back into people, it would be very difficult to control, says Osterholm. “There is no disease in the history of humankind that has disappeared from the face of the Earth when zoonotic disease was such an important part of, or played a role in, the transmission,” he says. The path that SARS-CoV-2 might take to become an endemic virus is challenging to predict, but society does have some control over it. In the next year or two, countries can reduce transmission with control measures until enough people have been vaccinated either to achieve herd immunity or to drastically reduce the severity of infections. That would significantly reduce deaths and severe disease, says Osterholm. But if countries abandon strategies to reduce spread and let the virus reign unchecked then “the darkest days of the pandemic are still ahead of us”, he says.

{"query": "2018–2019 Nigerian protests\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd SARS is a decentralised social movement, and series of mass protests against police brutality in Nigeria. The slogan calls for the disbanding of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a notorious unit of the Nigerian Police with a long record of abuses. [2][3] The protests which takes its name from the slogan started in 2017 as a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #EndSARS to demand the disbanding of the unit by the Nigerian government. [4][5][6] After experiencing a revitalisation in October 2020 following more revelations of the abuses of the unit, mass demonstrations occurred throughout the major cities of Nigeria, accompanied by vociferous outrage on social media platforms. About 28 million tweets bearing the hashtag have been accumulated on Twitter alone. [7] Solidarity protests and demonstrations by Nigerians in diaspora and sympathizers occurred in many major cities of the world. The protests is notable for its patronage by a demographic that is made of entirely young Nigerians. [8][9] The movement has since expanded to include demands for good and accountable governance. Within a few days of renewed protests, on 11 October 2020, the Nigerian Police Force announced that it was dissolving the unit with immediate effect. The move was widely received as a triumph of the demonstrations. [10] However, it was noted in many quarters that similar announcements had been made in recent years to pacify the public without the unit actually being disbanded, and that the government had merely planned to reassign and review SARS officers to medical centres rather than disband the unit entirely. [11] Protests have continued accordingly, and the Nigerian government has maintained a pattern of violent repression including the killing of demonstrators. [12] There have been international demonstrations in solidarity with those happening in the country, and the movement has also grown increasingly critical of Muhammadu Buhari's government response to the protests. [13]\n\nSARS officers have been alleged to profile young Nigerians, mostly males, based on fashion choices, tattoos and hairstyles. They were also known to mount illegal road blocks, conduct unwarranted checks and searches, arrest and detain without warrant or trial, rape women, and extort young male Nigerians for driving exotic vehicles and using laptops and iPhones. [14] Nigerians have shared both stories and video evidence of how officers of SARS engaged in kidnapping, murder, theft, rape, torture, unlawful arrests, humiliation, unlawful detention, extrajudicial killings and extortion of Nigerian citizens. A large section of the victims of the abuses of SARS have been young male Nigerians. [15][better source needed]\n\nThe Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was a branch of the Nigeria Police Force under the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID). It was founded in late 1992 as one of the 14 units in the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, which was established to detain, investigate, and prosecute people involved in crimes like armed robbery, kidnapping, and other violent crimes. [16] The squad was created as a masked police unit to perform undercover operations against violent crimes like armed robbery, car snatching, kidnapping, cattle rustling, and the bearing and use of illegal firearms. [17]\n\nSARS had been accused of several human rights violations, illegal \"stop and searches\", illegal arrests and detentions, extrajudicial killings, sexual harassment of women and brutalising of young male Nigerians. The human rights abuses were documented in trending videos on social media. [18]\n\nIn 2017, Nigerian activists, youth and celebrities across the nation took to the streets in a peaceful protest to spread awareness of SARS brutality and extortions and to demand its disbanding. The protests also moved to social media using the hashtag #EndSARS. [19][20][21]\n\nA 2016 report by Amnesty International, indicted SARS maintaining that the squad was responsible for human rights abuses, cruelty, degrading treatment of Nigerians in their custody, and other widespread torture. Some of the human rights abuses by SARS include the shooting of their detainees in the leg, mock executions and threats of execution, hanging and physical assault. [22] A 2020 publication by the organisation documented 82 cases of abuses and extra judicial killings by SARS between January 2017 and May 2020. [23]\n\nAmnesty International accused the SARS officials of regularly detaining young male Nigerians illegally and extorting money from their relatives. [4] In 2016, a human rights activist, Segun Awosanya popularly known as Segalink started EndSARS campaign on Twitter prompting police authority to announce reform of the police unit but nothing was achieved at the time. [24] In 2018, Nigerian rapper Michael Ugochukwu Stephens professionally known Ruggedman joined the campaign to end police brutality by releasing a single titled, Is Police Your Friend? [25] In 2017, a petition signed by 10,195 people was submitted to Nigeria's National Assembly calling for a total disbandment of SARS. [26] A few Senators backed the call for total disbandment of the unit. [27] Consideration was given to reforming the force, rather than full disbandment due to the number of cases falling. [28][29]\n\nThe campaigners moved from social media using the #EndSARS hashtag to organised, peaceful protests in Abuja, Lagos, Ibadan, Osun, Benin, Ughelli, Warri, Ilorin, Ogbomosho, Owerri, Jos, Kaduna, Calabar[30][20] and other Nigerian cities and states, threatening to continue if the government refused to disband the force. [31][32][33]\n\nNot only were there campaigners in Nigeria utilising the hashtag and having protests but they were also done in London and some parts of America recognising this situation as a global event. In response to the campaign, Nigeria Police Force Public Relations Officer Jimoh Moshood accused the campaigners of being \"criminals\". [34] Despite this, Inspector General of Nigeria Police Force Ibrahim K. Idris ordered the reform and reorganisation of SARS. [35]\n\nOn Saturday 3 October 2020, a video showing a SARS police officer shooting a young Nigerian in front of Wetland Hotel, Ughelli, Delta State trended on the Internet. It was alleged that the police officers took away the young man's vehicle – a Lexus SUV. [36] The trending video caused public outcry on social media, especially on Twitter, with the #ENDSARS hashtag trending. [37]\n\nJust as the ENDSARS trend began on Twitter, on Monday 5 October 2020, another report surfaced of SARS officers killing a 20-year-old upcoming musician named Daniel Chibuike, popularly called Sleek in his neighbourhood. [38] Sleek was said to be sitting in front of a hotel with a friend when the SARS officers approached them, prompting them to flee. According to an eyewitness, the SARS men pursued the pair, shouting \"thief\", before shooting Sleek as they ran through a supermarket. [38] His friend was arrested. On Thursday 8 October 2020, nationwide protests on ENDSARS started after weeks of outrage and anger with videos and pictures showing police brutality, harassment and extortion in Nigeria. The protests were led predominantly by young Nigerians in different cities alongside many activists and celebrities. [39] Nigeria Police Force disrupted the protests in some cities, throwing teargas, using water cannons and shooting at unarmed peaceful protesters as seen in Abuja and Osun. [40] This led to the death of Jimoh Isiaq in Ogbomoso, Oyo State. [41][14][42][43][44] By Wednesday, 14 October 2020, the End SARS protests were still on-going with young people in different parts of Nigeria intensifying their calls for reforms and accountability in police operations.

[1] It was the first fatal air crash for Malaysia Airlines[2][3] (as the airline is now known), with all 93 passengers and 7 crew killed. [4][5] The flight was apparently hijacked as soon as it reached cruise altitude. The circumstances in which the hijacking and subsequent crash occurred remain unsolved. The aircraft involved was a Boeing 737-2H6[note 1] registered as 9M-MBD. It had been delivered new to MAS in September 1972 with registration 9M-AQO. [6]\n\nFlight 653 departed from Runway 22 at Penang International Airport at exactly 19:21 for Kuala Lumpur's Subang Airport (now known as Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport).

[8] Subsequently, the pilots were forced to cut off all communications by a group of hijackers who suddenly barged into the cockpit. The tower immediately notified the authorities, who made emergency preparations at the airport. [9]\n\nA few minutes later, the crew radioed: \"We're now proceeding to Singapore. Good night. \"[10] In the last few minutes of the tapes from the cockpit voice recorder, investigators heard conversation between the pilots and the hijackers about how the aircraft would run out of fuel before it could make it to Singapore, followed by a series of gunshots. They concluded that both the pilot and co-pilot were fatally shot by the hijacker, which left the plane \"professionally uncontrolled\". [11] At 20:15, all communication with the aircraft was lost. At 20:36, the residents of Kampong Ladang, Tanjung Kupang in Johor reported hearing explosions and seeing burning wreckage in a swamp. The wreckage was later identified as the aircraft;  it had hit the ground at a near-vertical angle at a very high speed. There were no survivors.

{"query": "New kind of royals: On third anniversary, Harry and Meghan embrace revolutionized royal rolesPrince Harry and Duchess Meghan of Sussex   celebrate their third wedding anniversary Wednesday as royals in the process of reinventing themselves, devising new hybrid roles no other senior British royals have ever inhabited . Can they achieve all they desire? \"I personally feel Harry and Meghan are going to be just fine; what we don't know is the ramifications for the British royal family,\" says Nicoletta Gullace, associate professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, who specializes in modern British history. Still, it's a question no one could have imagined asking on May 19, 2018, when Harry married the former Meghan Markle in a joyful ceremony  at Windsor Castle that blended American grace with British pageantry.  On Wednesday, to mark their anniversary, the couple announced that their  Archewell Foundation and one of their charity partners, World Central Kitchen , would build a new community relief center in Mumbai, India, now dealing with a devastating second wave of COVID-19.  \"During future crises, these centers can be quickly activated as emergency response kitchens – or vaccination sites – and through calmer times they can serve as food distribution hubs, schools, clinics or community gathering spaces for families,\" according to a statement on the Archewell website. After their wedding, the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex were instant superstars. The empathetic ginger prince and the ambitious biracial actress were the face of the modern monarchy, a couple who could help connect a 1,000-year-old institution with millions of young British citizens of color and billions more in the Commonwealth around the globe.  They were going places, all agreed. No one thought they would just go .  But within two years of the wedding , they had thrown over their roles as working royals and fled to America in search of financial independence and freedom from the royal hierarchy.  They're not going back .  Even Madame Tussauds London has moved their wax figures out of the British royals exhibit , which includes Queen Elizabeth II and brother Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, to a glitzy new \"Awards Party\" zone, unveiled Monday . There they are center stage, surrounded by fellow Hollywood A-listers such as Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Nicole Kidman. Having swapped Frogmore Cottage for a Santa Barbara County mansion , they're living in Montecito as members of the celebrity elite. Their first child, Archie, is 2 and thriving , they're awaiting a baby girl  this summer and rolling out various charitable and entertainment deals . Meghan, 39, is publishing a children's book , while Harry, 36, is taking on new jobs , and both are making money as fast as they can. \"My take is they're picking up the torch of (Princess) Diana, creating a 'celebrity royal' role,\" says Gullace. \"What they're doing is very original in some ways – it's a modern blending of corporate deals, woke causes like mental health and women’s empowerment , and royal stardom, which is the secret sauce that makes everything they do so incredibly powerful.\"   'Feeding frenzy': Prince Harry criticized for calling First Amendment 'bonkers' What they're doing is actually unprecedented for any top British royal, says royal commentator Victoria Arbiter, daughter of a former press secretary to the queen who spent part of her childhood in Kensington Palace. \"They're trying to create a role in the U.S. that has not existed until now – they're still members of the royal family but they're not 'celebrities,' so what are they and why should we care? It's an interesting question in terms of deciding how to judge their success,\" Arbiter says. At the moment, the world is gobbling up every morsel about the Sussexes, and the media is happy to feed them, whether it's the caterwauling criticism of the British tabloids or the gushy reports in celebrity magazines . But will the media focus diminish if the transatlantic feuding, or the perception of feuding, dies down? \"They're keen to create a new niche for themselves but at the moment all anyone is interested in is their connection to the royal family,\" Arbiter says. \"I don't doubt their tenacity and desire to effect change, but how long will people remain interested when they stop talking about their pain  (in explaining their reasons for departing)? \"I worry looking ahead. I hope they and the family are able to find peace because family at the end of the day is all we really have.\" Princess Charlotte turns 6: See Duchess Kate's new birthday photo of the little royal The temptation is to compare Harry to ex-King Edward VIII , who abdicated in 1936 to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson, and spent the next 36 years in exile as the Duke of Windsor. But Harry is not an ex-king – he's not even an ex-prince – and so far he's not been idle.  What Harry and Meghan do have is royal charisma, which the royal family counted on to help promote the modern monarchy going forward, Gullace says. \"Now they're in Southern California hanging out with Hollywood royalty, but for the royal family, this is very disconcerting because suddenly (the Sussexes) are the most attention-getting members of the family,\" Gullace says. \"Not only are they popular, they are irresistible clickbait and anything they do or say garners enormous media attention, probably more than any other member including the queen.\" This tension echoes what happened when Prince Charles and Princess Diana's marriage fell apart in the 1990s and she emerged as a royal superstar , lobbing bombshell revelations and criticisms at her ex and the family before she died in a 1997 Paris car crash. Harry and Meghan: A timeline of the royal couple's relationship Here are the biggest moments from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's relationship. Staff Video, USA TODAY Back in Britain, the family is trying to cope with Harry and Meghan's competing star power while also dealing with the personal rifts that have opened up between Harry and his father and his brother, after the couple's  shattering interview with Oprah Winfrey in March. Among other claims, the Sussexes told Winfrey they left Britain because of alleged racism in the media and within the family. They said that a senior royal they would not identify expressed concern about the color of Archie's skin, and Meghan suggested racism may have prevented Archie from receiving the title of prince. \"That can’t be unsaid and it's tremendously damaging to the British monarchy,\" Gullace says.  A long-planned unveiling of a statue of Diana by her sons on what would have been her 60th birthday on July 1 may be in jeopardy, in part because of the brothers' falling out, the pandemic and the possibility that Harry and Meghan's baby will be born in June.  A royal love story: Look back at Prince Philip's 73-year marriage to Queen Elizabeth II It didn't help when Harry, interviewed last week by Dax Shepard on his podcast , said he'd become fed up with his royal job in his 20s, suggested he suffered under his father's parenting style, and promised he wouldn't pass on \"genetic pain\" to his own children.   On Monday, some Americans were up in arms over his comment on the podcast that, as a Brit, he doesn't really understand the First Amendment but thinks it's \"bonkers\" nonetheless. One reason why Britain is so desperate to see the royal family reconcile and move past all this, Gullace says, is that the monarchy is much weaker without Harry and Meghan just as it enters an era of increasing skepticism about crowned heads. Will young people be on board once the throne passes to King Charles III, now 72? \"The nature of the attacks by (the Sussexes) at this particular moment in history when racial sensitivities are heightened is an issue of real concern, and Harry and Meghan called that genie up,\" Gullace says.  Why did Prince Philip's Land Rover carry his casket?  The story behind the strange hearse Because of his relative closeness to the throne (Harry is sixth in line), he and Meghan don't have the freedom of living like his cousins, Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, Peter Phillips and Zara Phillips Tindall, who also are grandchildren of the queen but have careers and less paparazzi attention.   \"You say 'the queen' anywhere in the world and everyone knows exactly who you're talking about,\" Arbiter says. \"The British royals are unlike any other in terms of reach and global popularity and the impact they have had on the world.\" Harry and Meghan's bombshell interview: Oprah Winfrey was 'surprised' at how much they divulged So back to the question: Can Harry and Meghan achieve what they desire in America? Possibly, Arbiter says, but probably only if they stop with the recriminations. \"Since cutting the chains, they have a beautiful house in a beautiful area, they have amazing opportunities, people are knocking down their doors, but they have to start looking forward and not at all the ways they feel slighted and let down,\" Arbiter says. \"Until they commit to moving ahead with the future, which promises to be phenomenal if they just embrace it instead of looking back, then everybody can find peace.\"", "label": [{"name": "名人婚姻", "arguments": {"妻子（女方）": "Duchess Meghan of Sussex", "丈夫（男方）": "Prince Harry", "日期": "May 19, 2018", "婚礼地点": "at Windsor Castle"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "Long Beach’s aerospace sector reinvigorated by new companies, innovation with an eye on spaceRocket Lab’s Electron rocket takes off from the company’s New Zealand complex, Dec. 16, 2018. The ELaNa-19 mission delivered NASA nanosatellites into orbit.  Aviation and aerospace roots run deep in Long Beach—about 80 years to be exact. The sector has ebbed and flowed through the decades but has remained a constant force in the city. In the past, it was military and commercial aircraft. Today, companies have their sights set higher: Earth’s orbit and beyond. In 1940, construction began on an 11-building Douglas Aircraft facility on what is now the 220-acre Douglas Park. Business was booming due to World War II. At one point, some 160,000 workers were assembling planes in Long Beach, including many “Rosie the Riveters.” The war’s conclusion led to a cut in government contracts and the loss of thousands of jobs. Still, plane production continued in Long Beach under the name Douglas—bombers, Globemasters and eventually commercial airliners with the DC-8 and 9. In 1967, Douglas merged with McDonnell Aircraft Company to form the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which continued the city’s aerospace and aviation legacy with the production of the DC-10, the C-17 Globemaster III and more. In the mid-1990s, Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas for $13.3 billion and rebranded its airliners. But in 2006, Boeing ceased production of its commercial craft in Long Beach, leaving only the C-17 in production in the city with a small fraction of the workforce that once pumped out as many as one aircraft every hour. The C-17 operation was shuttered in 2015. Though airplane production in Long Beach is gone, Douglas Park today is home to dozens of industrial buildings, several of which are adding their own chapters to the city’s aerospace history. Over the last five years, Long Beach has become a growing hub for rocket manufacturing and small-satellite launch companies. The employment pool in Los Angeles County is highly desirable for tech companies. Long Beach, with a university of its own and its rich aerospace history, is an ideal location for these up-and-coming companies. Also, industrial real estate is virtually nonexistent across the county, particularly in the South Bay area, so the redevelopment of Douglas Park was able to draw in many companies looking to expand. “I’m proud to see the growth that our aerospace, rocket and satellite industry has had over the last several years in Long Beach,” Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia said. “There’s no doubt that investment in supporting this industry in the months and years ahead will help us strengthen and build back the Long Beach and regional economy.” Here is a look at four innovative aerospace operations that now call Long Beach home. Virgin Orbit Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne rocket—carrying a payload of 10 small satellites—deploys from Cosmic Girl, the company’s modified 747, Jan. 17, 2021.  In 2015, Virgin Galactic—the human spaceflight and transportation arm of Sir Richard Branson’s empire—moved into its new home in one of the first phases of Douglas Park Development. In 2017, the Long Beach facility transitioned to become the home of Virgin Orbit, a new branch of the company dedicated to a new method of launching smallsats into orbit. Virgin Galactic continues its operations outside of Long Beach. While most rockets launch from a stationary ground platform, the Virgin Orbit team has developed a method similar to military aircraft weapons systems: the company mounts its 70-square-foot LauncherOne rocket under the wing of the firm’s Boeing 747 jet, aptly named Cosmic Girl. When the plane reaches 35,000 feet, LauncherOne is deployed, propelling itself through the Earth’s atmosphere to deliver its smallsat payload. The company’s first launch attempt on Memorial Day last year failed because of a breach in a high-pressure line carrying cryogenic liquid oxygen, causing the engine to stop providing thrust. But Virgin Orbits’ second attempt was another story. “It was unbelievable,” President and Chief Executive Dan Hart said in an interview. “Absolutely superb.” Cosmic Girl’s second mission was not merely a test flight, Hart said. After much discussion with NASA, the company upped the mission’s ante and put a 10-satellite payload into its LauncherOne system. “Scientists and students had spent years developing these satellites, so the sense of responsibility was pretty heavy on the team,” Hart said. “It was a lot of work—long hours, solving lots of problems along the way. But as the flight works out, knowing we are traveling somewhere, getting to space, it’s an incredible combination of fatigue and euphoria. “When we released all 10 satellites in perfect orbit, everyone on the team had this incredible grin on these tired faces,” Hart added. “It was really beautiful to behold.” With the successful launch and delivery of multiple satellites, Virgin Orbit is pushing forward, Hart said. The company has three more flights slated for 2021 and Hart said he expects to double the number of missions in 2022. Depending on demand, Hart said Virgin Orbits’ current capability is about 20 launches per year, which is only hampered by manufacturing limitations. If demand were to exceed those limitations, Hart said, the company could tap into other resources to “easily” double production. Other than manufacturing limitations, the only other cap on LauncherOne missions is the number of times a 747 can take off each year, Hart said. In a Jan. 18 tweet, Former Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Air Force Will Roper said the Virgin Orbit technology is “the satellite equivalent of keeping an ace up your sleeve.” “This is a big disruptor—and hopefully a deterrent—for future space conflicts,” he tweeted. Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne attached to the companies modified Boeing 747 prior to its first successful mission in January 2021. Photo courtesy of Virgin Orbit. Virgin Orbit has a wide array of contracts with various missions attached to each. The Department of Defense, NASA, the Royal Netherlands Air Force, a consortium of Polish universities and numerous other public and private organizations have all signed on with Virgin Orbit, Hart said. Most of the company’s contracts are for missions to deliver payloads into Earth’s orbit, Hart explained. But the firm is working with one group on a potential mission to Mars and has had some discussions about a Venus mission, he said. When Virgin Orbit was first established in Long Beach, the company had about 230 employees in one building. Since then, the firm has expanded into a second building and boasts more than 500 employees. “Long Beach has been an aerospace center for many years,” Hart said of the company’s decision to be based in the city. “There is such talent. We have brought in a number of people right out of school or early in their career. And it’s wonderfully diverse, energetic, creative and youthful. It’s a unique place to live.” SpinLaunch One Long Beach aerospace company is pioneering a new method of smallsat ground launch that would literally hurl its payload into space using kinetic energy. Founded in 2014 by Chief Executive Jonathan Yaney in Sunnyvale, the company is developing a ground-based launch system that uses a large electrical mass accelerator to provide the initial thrust, propelling smallsats into orbit at hypersonic speeds. SpinLaunch relocated its headquarters to Long Beach in January 2019, where it took over a new 140,000-square-foot industrial and office building with about 30 employees and grand plans. “Long Beach has become an important hub for … aerospace, innovation,” Yaney said, noting that the move has allowed him to expand his company in a region where industrial real estate is hard to come by. Over the last two years, thanks to various investors and funding sources, including a recent contract with the Department of Defense for a prototype, Yaney said SpinLaunch has quadrupled its staff as it pushes forward with development. Yaney said his team has made strides in technology development and advancement of its launch facilities over the last year. While not ready to share details of its progress, Yaney said the company will soon be announcing milestones associated with its Spaceport America-based suborbital launch platform. Aside from the ability to expand, Yaney said he was drawn to Long Beach because of the area’s work pool, Douglas Park’s proximity to Long Beach Airport and walkable amenities such as dining and shopping. “[The city] has historically played a key role in Southern California’s history of aviation and aerospace and is experiencing a rebirth with New Space,” Yaney said of the industry’s recent commercialisation after years of governmental monopoly. Rocket Lab Long Beach’s most seasoned rocket manufacturer, Rocket Lab, was founded in 2006 by New Zealand engineer Peter Beck. The aerospace manufacturer became a U.S. company in 2013, setting up its headquarters in Huntington Beach. But the Orange County beach city was too far removed from prospective employees in Los Angeles County, Beck said, which was a major factor for the company’s move to Long Beach at the start of 2020. Additionally, like Virgin and SpinLaunch, the company signed a lease for a brand new building in Douglas Park and was able to build out the interior to their specifications, Beck said. While Virgin and SpinLaunch are using—or developing—new technologies to deliver payloads into space, Rocket Lab is using traditional rockets built in Long Beach and launched from land-based pads in Virginia and New Zealand. Combined, both complexes are licensed for up to 130 launches per year. A component of Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket seperates as it enters a new phase of its “As the Crow Flies” mission in October 2019. Photo courtesy of Rocket Lab. In 2017, the company launched one rocket. In 2018, three rockets. In 2019, six. “[We were] on track to maintain that cadence in 2020 before COVID-19 led to statewide and New Zealand national lockdowns, which temporarily halted launch operations,” the company said in an email. Still, the company managed seven launches in 2020. Rocket Launch has 12 launches slated for 2021, including a moon mission for NASA. “The only other people who launch more than us are countries,” Beck said. Over the course of 17 missions, Rocket Lab has successfully delivered more than 97 satellites into orbit, Beck said, including the Nov. 19 “Return to Sender” mission, which deployed 29 smallsats. “We have a private mission to Venus and a bunch of other interplanetary missions that we get to announce soon from various customers,” Beck said. In addition to its successful payload delivery, “Return to Sender” marked Rocket Lab’s first attempt at “first stage recovery.” After the first stage of rocket flight, a portion of the rocket separates as it enters the second phase. Rocket Lab successfully retrieved the first stage component, which represents a major milestone in making its Electron a reusable rocket and allow the company to increase launch frequency. But 2020 wasn’t all success for Rocket Lab. In addition to the turbulence brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company’s Fourth of July mission that featured payloads from Canon Electronics, among others—and dubbed “Pics or it Didn’t Happen”—failed to reach orbit and deliver its payload of seven satellites. A single faulty electrical connection was determined to be the cause of the failure. Rocket Lab has about 100 production and assembly staff in Long Beach to build its rockets and staff its mission control. But among multiple facilities around the world, the company has 530 employees. Rocket Lab, unlike the other Long Beach-based companies, has also branched out beyond launches and is producing components for the satellites themselves. The latest addition to the satellite division came in March 2020, when Rocket Lab announced the acquisition of Toronto-based Sinclair Interplanetary. Relativity Space The new kid on Long Beach’s proverbial space block is Relativity Space, founded in 2015 by Tim Ellis and Jordan Noone in Los Angeles. Like Rocket Lab, Relativity is in the business of producing traditional rockets used for smallsat deliveries. But while 3-D printing has been used by Rocket Lab and the aerospace industry at large for years in parts production, Relativity has taken it a step further. “We’re currently building the Terran 1, which is the first entirely 3-D printed rocket,” said Caryn Schenewerk, the company’s vice president of regulatory and government affairs. “We’re building humanity’s multi-planetary future.” To print entire rockets, Relativity created Stargate, a system that uses laser beams to melt metal wire and form each component. The wire is made of a metal developed by Relativity. Stargate is a 3-D printing system developed by Relativity Space used to print 95% of its rockets. The system uses lasers to melt a metal also developed by Relativity into each component. Photo courtesty of Relativity Space. Whereas Virgin Orbit and Rocket Lab’s vehicles can carry payloads of smallsats between 500 kg (about 1,100 pounds) and 300 kg (about 660 pounds) respectively, the Terran 1 is capable of delivering payloads of up to 1,250 kg (about 2,756 pounds). The rocket will still be carrying smallsats, but they will be on the larger side of the spectrum, sometimes nearly 500 kg. Relativity is still in the development phase, with tests of its engines taking place at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The company is constructing its launch site at Cape Canaveral in Florida and is slated for its first launch later this year, which will be a demonstration mission, Scherewerk said. Schenewerk said Relativity also is working to set up a second launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base on the West Coast within the next year. For the next few years, Relativity’s missions will remain in the single digits, Schenewerk said. But with the capability of building a vehicle from start to finish in 60 days, she said the company will be positioned to be part of a rapid response launch, a term used by Space Force to describe rapidly deployed craft for various missions. Sales for Relativity’s service have been “robust,” Schenewerk said, noting two recent contracts with NASA and global security and aerospace company Lockheed Martin. The company moved into its new home at Douglas Park last summer, while the pandemic was wreaking havoc on most industries. But most of the company’s employees were well equipped to work at home, Schenewerk said, giving the company time to work on the build-out of its new facility and to bring its printers online. The flexible work environment stemming from the pandemic, Schenewerk said, also has helped the company handle its quickly multiplying growth at its new home. “We’ve more than doubled in size in the last year,” Schenewerk said, noting that the company has grown from around 100 employees before its move to Long Beach to around 280 now. “We’ll be in the 500-employee range by the end of this year is the expectation.” To accommodate its growth, Schenewerk said the company is working with city officials to identify opportunities for expansion within Long Beach but would not disclose any details. Schenewerk did say that the company is working with Pacific Gateway, Long Beach’s workforce development arm, to tap into the area’s diversity. “We’re building rockets but we’re also trying to build a company that thinks about the inclusive future of aerospace for the workforce that is engaging in these exciting endeavors,” she said. “Long Beach has a long history of aerospace and aviation and there is a great opportunity to work with the city to continue that history.”  ", "label": [{"name": "航天新成就", "arguments": {"合作机构": "The Department of Defense, NASA, the Royal Netherlands Air Force, a consortium of Polish universities and numerous other public and private organizations", "研究机构": "Rocket Lab", "运载火箭": "LauncherOne rocket", "航天器": "Electron rocket", "发射地点": "the company’s New Zealand complex", "发射日期": "Jan. 17, 2021", "发言人": "Dan Hart"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "A dam collapsed at a mine in south-east BrazilBRUMADINHO, Brazil (REUTERS) - Thirty-four people were confirmed dead and nearly 300 missing on Saturday (Jan 26), with hopes fading of them being found alive, after a dam collapsed at a mine in south-east Brazil. The disaster struck on Friday at the Vale mine near the city of Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais state, spewing millions of tons of muddy sludge across the facility and down towards farmland alongside the nearby town of Brumadinho. Dozens of helicopters were used in the rescue operation Saturday because the released mud engulfed buildings, vehicles and roads with a deep, treacherous layer. Rescue officials announced the death toll had more than tripled through the day as more and more bodies were pulled from the mud. By the last count, nearly 300 people were missing, virtually all of them mine workers listed by Vale. Among the more than 170 survivors rescued, 23 were hospitalised with injuries. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro flew over the devastated zone, later tweeting that it was \"difficult to not be emotional before this scene.\" All was being done to care for survivors and \"determine the facts, to demand justice and prevent new tragedies,\" he added. The military said it was deploying 1,000 troops, including sniffer dogs, to the affected zone under orders from the president. The disaster was the first big emergency faced by Bolsonaro and his government since he took office in early January, and perhaps one of the biggest disasters in Brazil's history. Vale has been shaken by the disaster, the second in three years it has suffered in the same state. Workers at its mine had been lunching in an administrative area Friday when they were suddenly engulfed by millions of tons of muddy trailings - a waste byproduct of the iron-ore mining operations. The ruptured dam, 42 years old and 86m high, had been in the process of being decommissioned, and Vale said it had recently passed structural safety tests. After overflowing a second dam, the vast muddy mass barreled down toward Brumadinho, population 39,000, but only glanced along it before spearing its way through vegetation and farmland, smashing houses and swallowing tractors and roads in its way. Vale CEO Fabio Schvartsman and Minas Gerais Governor Romeu Zema both expressed pessimism, warning the toll could rise. \"From now, the odds are minimal (to find more people alive) and it is most likely we will recover only bodies,\" Zema told reporters late on Friday. In Rio, Schvartsman spoke of a \"human tragedy.\" \"We're talking about probably a large number of victims - we don't know how many but we know it will be a high number,\" he said. Vale shares plummeted on the New York stock exchange Friday, closing eight per cent lower. Brazil's environmental protection agency hit Vale with an initial US$66.5 million (S$90 million) fine over the disaster. Minas Gerais state authorities said they were about to levy another penalty. They have already obtained a court order blocking US$270 million of Vale funds in bank accounts with a view to using it for victim relief. The mining company, one of the world's biggest, was involved in a 2015 mine collapse elsewhere in Minas Gerais that claimed 19 lives and is regarded as the country's worst-ever environmental disaster. Would-be rescue volunteers were urged to stay away because of the slippery, perilous mud. Media were pressed not to use drones to avoid collisions with search and rescue helicopters. \"There used to be people here, houses. I'm just floored by this tragedy,\" Rosilene Aganetti, a 57-year-old resident in one of the affected villages, told AFP, pointing to an expanse of mud. \"Several of my friends who were in the Vale cafeteria are missing,\" she said, holding back sobs. Another woman, Suely de Olivera Costa, desperately trying to find her husband who worked at the mine, accused Vale of \"destroying Brumadinho and nobody is doing anything - what will be the next town?\" The Brazil office of environmentalist group Greenpeace said the dam break was \"a sad consequence of the lessons not learned by the Brazilian government and the mining companies.\" Such incidents \"are not accidents but environmental crimes that must be investigated, punished and repaired,\" it added. While the death toll has yet to be fully established, the disaster at the mine could well rank among the worst recorded in Brazil. In 2008, a moving mass of mud and rocks from an illegal iron ore mine slammed into the Chinese town of Taoshi, in northern Shanxi province, killing 262 people.

Again in November, Bedouins in the Negev called for a Day of Rage against their displacement. Following announcements that the new government plans to gradually incorporate the Haredi Jewish population of Israel into the country's armed forces, there were widespread protests against the government and the draft.

{"query": "2005 Quebec student protestsThe 2005 Quebec student protests were a series of student strikes and student protests in opposition to budget cuts of C$103 million in the Grants and Loans program by the Charest government. It occurred between February 24 and April 2005 and involved thousands of CEGEP and universities students from across Quebec. During the 2003 Quebec general election campaign, the Liberal Party of Quebec, led by Jean Charest, made a promise to freeze education cost. Having to deal with a rough budget, and because of the election promise, the Quebec government changed the Grants and Loans program by transforming $103 million of grants into loans, nearly doubling the debt of the poorest students. Coalitions representing most CEGEPs and universities started to negotiate with the government. Talks and protests, in the form of marches, went on for over a year. Students from most CEGEPs and universities took the streets on April 14, 2004 (the first anniversary of the Charest government's election) and November 10, 2004. During their January 29–30, 2005 congress, the students' unions members of the ASSÉ (Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante) and other independent students' unions decide to form the Coalition de l'Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante Élargie (CASSÉÉ) to coordinate the upcoming strike campaign. (\"Cassé\" is a French word equivalent to \"broke\".) The strike was initiated on February 21, by a member of the CASSÉÉ, the anthropology students' association from University of Montreal (Association étudiante d'anthropologie de l'Université de Montréal). But the real start was given on February 24 when over 30,000 students members of the CASSÉÉ, and a few other unions joined the strike. The FECQ and the FEUQ, federations of CEGEP and university unions, called for a student strike on March 4 and March 9[1] respectively. By March 15, over 100,000 students were on strike. This turn of events surprised many, as these organizations were traditionally opposed to strikes/boycotts as a negotiation tactic. [citation needed]\n\nOn March 16, 2005 students from traditionally more moderate institutions like École Polytechnique de Montréal, as well as from Concordia University and McGill's Post-Graduate Student Society joined the strike for 24 hours. Between 10,000 and 100,000 students (80,000 being the number most reported)[citation needed] took the streets for a peaceful march in Montreal, creating the largest student protest staged in Quebec until March 22, 2012. The École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Montréal and McGill University undergraduates Students' Society of McGill University joined the strike on March 18 for 24 symbolic hours, though the McGill boycott went largely unobserved and further action was rejected by the student body through an online poll. This constituted the first strike since 1967 for the HEC and the first strike in 40 years for Polytechnique. On April 2, the student federations and the government reached an agreement that was still left to be voted on by the individual student associations during the week. This agreement consists of a CAN $70M refunding for 2005–2006 and a return of the $103M for the next 4 years, totaling $482M. This money comes from 3 levels: the millennium grant foundation, the federal government and the provincial government. The FEUQ officially endorsed the agreement, while the FECQ maintained a neutral position, saying it was \"interesting enough\" to be voted on by the individual members' unions. The CASSÉÉ rejected it. Over the next week, the movement mostly ended, with over two thirds of the students voting for a return to class during the week. However, at least 20 unions representing over 100,000 students rejected the offer and by April 11, there were still approximately 20,000 students boycotting class. During the following 2 weeks, most associations ended or suspended the boycott to allow the students to complete their semester. The symbol of support for the student strike was a small square of red cloth worn upon clothing as a kind of ribbon. The Parti Québécois MNAs, then in opposition, wore the red square to demonstrate their support for the striking students. On March 30, a group of students hoisted the symbol opposed to student poverty on Mount Royal Cross. It took a full day before authorities were able to remove it. On its lower panel, it was written: \"Arrêtons de sacrifier nos enfants\", which means: \"Let's stop sacrificing our children.\"", "label": [{"name": "抗议", "arguments": {"日期": "between February 24 and April 2005", "抗议者": "CEGEP and universities students from across Quebec", "抗议原因": "opposition to budget cuts of C$103 million in the Grants and Loans program by the Charest government"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

In a joint release sent to Japanese media, the couple said: \"From here on, we hope to support each other and build a fulfilling life together.\" The A-list couple were the leads on the drama We Married As A Job (2016), which also filmed a New Year's special that aired earlier this year (2021). They played a couple in the hugely successful series, which was popular in the region. Hoshino, a multi-hyphenate known for his acting, singing and writing, said in a letter posted on social media: \"The last time I made such a public announcement was when I had to suspend my entertainment activities due to my bad health. To be able to share such happy news to those who worried about me then, and those who have supported me to this day - I am filled with gratitude.\" One of the most popular J-pop singers, the 40-year-old temporarily put his career on hold in 2012 due to bleeding in his brain. He is known for songs such as Koi, the theme song of We Got Married As A Job, which went viral in Japan when it was released. Aragaki, 32, rose to prominence in the tragic romance film Koizora (2007) and has since become one of the best-loved Japanese actresses, starring in series such as Legal High (2012 to 2013).

{"query": "2015–16 Great Britain and Ireland floods\n\nThe 2015–2016 Great Britain and Ireland floods were a series of heavy rainfall events which led to flooding during the winter of late 2015 and early 2016. Western Europe saw a series of extratropical cyclones forming in a westerly flow over the Atlantic, directing warm and moist air to the region. A situation developed in a similar manner to that seen during the Autumn 2000 western Europe floods, which saw catchments and soils becoming increasingly saturated. During November high rainfalls associated with the passage of Storm Abigail and the remains of Ex-hurricane Kate brought increasingly high river flows. [2] Many parts of north-west Britain saw almost double the average monthly rainfall for November fall, with the month becoming the second-wettest to affect north-west England and North Wales (behind November 2009) since records began in 1910. \n\nStorm Desmond broke the United Kingdom's 24-hour rainfall record, with 341.4 mm of rain falling at Honister Pass, Cumbria, on 5 December 2015. [6] The previous record was set in 2009, also in Cumbria, when 316.4 mm of rain fell in Seathwaite. [6] The highest standard 0900 GMT – 0900 GMT rain day record, however, remains 279 mm at Martinstown, Dorset set on 18 July 1955. Much of the historical data is recorded in this way. [7] The 48‑hour rainfall record was also beaten, with Thirlmere reporting 405 mm of rain falling up to 0800 GMT on 6 December 2015, compared to the previous record of 395.6 mm on 18–19 November 2009 at Seathwaite. [7] Desmond created an atmospheric river in its wake, bringing in moist air from the Caribbean to the British Isles. As a result, rainfall from Desmond was unusually heavy, with the Norwegian Meteorological Institute designating Desmond an extreme weather event as a result of the amount of rain that fell. The heavy rainfall caused a waterfall to appear at Malham Cove for a short period of time; this had not previously happened in living memory. [8]\n\nHeavy rainfall from Desmond caused severe disruption. Appleby, Keswick and Kendal in the English county of Cumbria suffered blocked roads, collapsed bridges and some homes were evacuated; Cumbria Police declared the situation a \"major incident\". [9]  Many houses in Carlisle were flooded, and tens of thousands of properties in Lancaster lost power when a sub-station was flooded. [10]\n\nAs a result of this event 3,500 properties were flooded in the UK, mostly in NW England, 2,000 of these in Carlisle. [11] The village of Glenridding flooded for a second time on 9 December. [12]\n\nIn the county three bridges were washed away, Coledale High Bridge in Braithwaite, the Fitz Footbridge in Keswick, and that at Pooley Bridge in the Eden District. [13] Part of the A591 road an important north-south artery between Grasmere and Keswick in the Lake District, was washed away at Dunmail Raise with a landslip occurring adjacent to Thirlmere. \n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the worst affected areas were the province of Connacht and counties Donegal, Westmeath, Tipperary, Limerick, Clare, Cork and Kerry. Several, particularly local, roads were closed as a result of rivers breaching their banks and excess rainfall. In Connacht, the damage was worst in Athleague, Ballinasloe, Carrick-on-Shannon, Claregalway, Crossmolina, Foxford and Galway City. Millions of euros worth of damage was caused in Bandon, Fermoy, Kenmare and Tralee, while the Blackpool area of Cork City was severely affected by a high level of water flow in the River Lee. Heavy rain has also resulted in severe flooding in communities along the River Shannon, namely Athlone, Portumna, Shannon Harbour, Montpelier, Castleconnell, Clonlara, Parteen, Annacotty and Limerick City. The river breached its banks in Athlone on 9 December. [16] Other areas affected due to heavy rainfall included Bray, Clonmel and Ennis. In Glaslough, County Monaghan, the dead body of a 70-year-old man was found when his car was believed to have become trapped in a dipped part of a flooded road. [17]\n\nApproximately 1,000 people were evacuated from their homes in the town of Hawick in the Scottish Borders as a result of the River Teviot flooding. The River Nith burst its banks in Dumfries, flooding part of the town,[18] with a major emergency being declared in Dumfries & Galloway as a result. [19] Landslides and flooding closed some main roads in Scotland. Counties Down and Tyrone in Northern Ireland suffered road closures from fallen trees. [9]\n\nFurther heavy rainfall exacerbated existing problems on the Isle of Man, which had been struck by localised flash flooding on 3 December,[20] with warnings that Desmond could bring more flooding and more damage to the island. [21]\n\nIn Wales, heavy rainfall led to flooding close to Llandygai, near Bangor in Gwynedd, with RNLI coastguard helicopters rescuing one person from their car. [22] Flooding was also reported on Anglesey, in parts of Powys and in and around the South Wales city of Swansea. [22] Wind damage was reported in Llandudno and winds gusted to 83 mph within the Snowdonia National Park. Eva was the fifth storm to be officially named by Met Éireann on 22 December 2015, with an orange wind warning being issued for counties Clare, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal. Gales were also expected in the northwest of the UK, with storm force winds over parts of the Outer Hebrides. [23]\n\nRain associated with the passage of Eva caused further disruption when rivers burst their banks in the Cumbrian towns of Appleby, Keswick and Kendal on 22 December, with Appleby receiving three to four feet of flood water.  The village of Glenridding was badly flooded for the third time in the month. [26] 6000 houses in Ireland were left without power. [27] Liz Truss convened a COBRA meeting to decide on emergency measures, which included the deployment of soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, Duke of Lancaster's Regiment[28] to the affected areas.  On 24 December, flood defence gates were closed in Carlisle, Keswick and Cockermouth to limit the damage of rainfall and 20 water pumps and two kilometres of temporary flood barriers were transported to northern England. [31] Ferries operating between Dublin and Holyhead were cancelled due to bad weather on the Irish Sea. [32]\n\nThe Environment Agency issued seven severe flood warnings across Lancashire and 21 severe flood warnings across Yorkshire on 26 December. [33]\n\nThe worst of the flooding occurred on the night of Christmas Day and throughout Boxing Day across Lancashire and Yorkshire. On 26 December, homes were evacuated in Calder Valley, West Yorkshire, and in Ribchester and Whalley, Lancashire; according to the Environment Agency, every river in Lancashire peaked at their highest levels since records began. [33]\n\nFlooding caused at least two explosions in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, as gas mains were ruptured. One explosion and subsequent fire occurred as a result of a footbridge being swept away by the River Irwell, with footage of the incident being widely shared on social media.

{"query": "Alliance Air Flight 7412 crashAlliance Air Flight 7412 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight operated by Alliance Air, a subsidiary of the airline Indian, from Kolkata's Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi. On 17 July 2000, while on approach to its first stopover in Patna, the Boeing 737-2A8 operating the route nose-dived and crashed into a residential area in Patna, killing 60 people including 5 on the ground. The final report, investigated by the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation, concluded that the cause of the crash was due to pilot error. [1]\n\nFlight 7412 departed Calcutta (Kolkata) at 06:51 on 17 July 2000, for a flight to Delhi, with stops at Patna and Lucknow. Patna ATC asked the aircraft at 07:17 to report for descent and also to check descent traffic with Kolkata Area Control. The aircraft soon responded that Kolkata had reported negative traffic. Flight 7412 was then cleared for descent to FL75 and asked to report 25 NM and the same was reported by the aircraft at 07:26. Flight 7412 was cleared to descend to 4000 ft. and was asked to report for approach runway 25. [1]\n\nAt 07:28, Flight 7412 reported commencing the turn and at 07:31 reported crossing the airport area and coming up on the localiser. Flight 7412 was then asked to descend to 1700 ft. The crew had been cleared to land at runway 25 at Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Airport at Patna when the pilots requested a 360-degree orbit due to the flight being high on the approach. Permission was granted and a left turn was initiated. During the left turn, the aircraft stalled. The plane then grazed a few single-storied houses in a government residential housing estate and crashed in a government residential colony behind Gardani Bagh Girls School at Anishabad, which is located about 2 km southwest of the Patna Airport. [2] The aircraft broke into four pieces. [2]\n\nWhen the aircraft struck the residential quarters and the ground, the impact was severe. The intensity of post impact fire was also severe. Initially, seven passengers were extricated alive. Of them, six were seriously injured. Miraculously, one of the passengers walked out of the wreckage without much injury even though he had a minor concussion and was treated later. Of the six injured passengers, four died subsequently. Two passengers recovered completely after treatment. [1]\n\nThe airport ambulance had proceeded to the crash site along with the CFTs. Two injured passengers were transported to the PMCH in the first instance. Subsequently, the second ambulance from the airport was also pressed into service to transport the remaining injured passengers for medical aid. Shortly after the arrival of the airport ambulance, ambulances from other assisting agencies also arrived and helped in removing all the injured for medical aid. [1]\n\nThe accident site was 5–6 km from the airport. The fire personnel reached the site in 5 to 6 minutes (local residents stated that the tenders reached only after 15–20 minutes). The first Crash Fire Tender (CFT) laid two hoses and began to fight the fire; however, it failed in 3 minutes. After failing in their efforts to rectify the fault, the CFT crew had to call a mechanic from the airport and the CFT was put back into operation after an hour. However, after a few minutes of operation, it went back to the airport to refill water. On the way it broke down twice. [3]\n\nThe second CFT after a few minutes of operation had to return to the airport to refill water. The crowd that collected within a short time was unmanageable and definitely hampered the rescue operations. According to witnesses, crowd tempers ran high and there was a general tendency to target anybody in uniform or position of authority with verbal abuse and physical violence. At times there were hundreds of people trying to climb on to the rescue vehicles to get a better view. It was only after the arrival of the Bihar military police jawans and the army contingent that some semblance of crowd control was achieved. [3]\n\nThe aircraft involved in the accident was a Boeing 737-200. Boeing 737-200 is a twin-engine jet transport airplane manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, USA. It is designed to operate over short to medium ranges at cruise speeds of approximately 950 kilometres per hour (km/h). Two P&W JT8D/17A engines power the aircraft, each developing approximately 16,000 pounds (lbf) of thrust at sea level. [1]\n\nThe aircraft involved in the accident was registered in India as VT-EGD with a serial number of MSN22280. The aircraft was manufactured in 1980 and sold to Indian Airlines. It was subsequently leased to Alliance Air in 1999. [1]\n\nThe aircraft in question, VT-EGD, had been involved in an earlier accident. On 15 January 1986, the pilot of flight 529 attempted to land at Tiruchirapalli in conditions below weather minima (reported Wx was exactly the minima). During a go-around (wave-off, just before touch down) the wing contacted the runway due to an excessive bank angle (the delay in spool-up times for both engines were more than 5 seconds apart with the right engine slow). The HIALS was not switched on at the time 529 was approaching and the ATC anemometer was unserviceable. The wing was substantially damaged, but there were no injuries among the 6 crew and 122 passengers. The pilot displayed great skill in manually flying the B737 at FL100 and diverted to Chennai and landed safely with flight controls in \"manual reversion\" on runway 07[2][4] The aircraft was to be phased out by the end of the year per Indian government guidelines which do not allow aircraft over 20 years old to operate in Indian airspace.", "label": [{"name": "空难", "arguments": {"航空公司": "Alliance Air", "地点": "a residential area in Patna", "航班号": "Flight 7412", "日期": "17 July 2000", "计划降落地点": "Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi", "人员伤亡": "killing 60 people including 5 on the ground", "事故调查员": "Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

The protests took place on 25 April – 2 May 2013 and were organised by the Center for Inquiry (CFI), American Atheists, and the International Humanist and Ethical Union. [1][2] Demonstrations were held in Dhaka, New York City, Washington, D.C., London, Ottawa and other cities around the world. [2] Secularists sought to express their solidarity with those jailed for speaking their minds about religion. Protesters drew attention to those who were being persecuted for exercising free speech, seeking to convince the international community to exert influence to have the bloggers set free by the Bangladeshi government. [3]\n\nThe events that sparked the rallies began during the shahbag protest when Bangladeshis rallied on the streets to demand capital punishment for Abdul Quader Molla, a war criminal of the Bangladesh liberation war and a leader of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. During the protests, Ahmed Rajib Haider, a blogger who was critical of Jamaat-e-Islami, was stabbed to death by Jamaat activists[4] Another controversial author, blogger & online activist named Sunnyur Rahman, popularly known as 'Nastik Nobi' (Atheist Prophet) in the blog community, was also stabbed on 7 March 2013. [5]\n\nMembers of hardline Muslim group, Hifazat-e-Islam, backed by Jamaat, began a violent protest demanding authorities enact harsh anti-blasphemy laws to punish those who insult Islam, calling the bloggers \"anti-Islamic\" and terming all participants of the shahbag movement \"atheists. \"[6]\n\nIn response to these events, the government of Bangladesh set up a panel to monitor blasphemy on social media and blocked a number of blogs and websites.

{"query": "Air France Flight 1611 crashAir France Flight 1611 (AF1611) was a Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle III en route from Ajaccio, in the island of Corsica, to Nice, France, on 11 September 1968 when it crashed into the Mediterranean Sea off Nice, killing all 95 on board. According to the official report, the crash was non-survivable. [2] The Ajaccio-Nice Caravelle crash is the deadliest aviation incident in the Mediterranean Sea to date. [1]\n\nThe probable cause was attributed to a fire of uncertain origin which originated in the rear of the cabin. There was early speculation that the plane was hit by a surface-to-air missile, since there is a firing area not far from the crash site. Although the hypothesis was officially discarded by the inquiry board, many victims' relatives still have doubts and have asked to have access to classified documents about the event. In December 1972, the inquiry board of the French ministry of transportation published its official report. [2] The report surmised that the loss of the aircraft had been caused by a fire in the passenger toilet caused either by a defective water heater or a cigarette discarded in a waste bin. This rejected the suggestion of any missile strike, basing its findings on the aircraft's survival time after the pilot's initial report to air traffic control of a fire on board, the examination of the wreckage recovered from the seabed, knowledge of a similar accidental fire in another Sud Aviation Caravelle, and the declaration by the French defence ministry that there were no surface ships in the area capable of launching missiles. Among the dead was French general René Cogny. On 10 May 2011, Michel Laty, a former army typist, alleged on French television channel TF1 that he saw a report indicating a missile, misfired by the French army during a weapon test, in fact caused the crash. [3][4]\n\nA 2019 article in The Guardian newspaper reported that, after the crash, documents and photographs about it disappeared. The 11 September page in the log book for Le Suffren, a French Navy missile frigate in the area, was torn out. The aircraft's black box flight recorder was said to have been damaged, with the recording of flight AF1611 unreadable, although earlier flights were recorded. Wreckage recovered was seized by France's military. An investigation was started in 2011 by gendarmes, and in September 2019 the theory that a fire had started in a toilet was disproved. A family member of one of those killed said \"The investigating judge has said he is practically certain to almost 100% that the plane was hit by a missile. Now we are waiting\". French president Emmanuel Macron wrote to a victim's family, saying that he hoped the affair would be declassified, and that he had asked the armed forces minister to begin the process of releasing documents related to the crash.

{"query": "April_2017 Strikes continue in the University of Puerto Rico because of university budget cuts from the Puerto Rico Oversight Board (PROMESA). (Pasquines)The University of Puerto Rico has been on a systematic indefinite strike since April 5. On that day the strike was approved and since then ten out of eleven (with the Medical Science campus holding a 72 hour strike in lieu) campuses have joined in this strike as a sign of unity. Students have said that the strike will only be lifted until the following conditions are met:\nThese conditions are critical to understanding why the university student body has decided on an indefinite strike instead of the individual and shorter strikes that each campus has made.  \nThe University of Puerto Rico has been threatened by a budget cut suggested by the Oversight Board and enforced by the government. The students fear that the budget cuts will affect the university’s capacity to attend to student’s needs, to function at its full capacity and that it would mean the closing of campuses. Interim President Nivia Fernandez’s resignation has been solicited by student leaders due to her position in favoring the budget cuts. In February, then Interim President Celeste Freytes had asked as to how the Oversight Board had arrived at what was then a $300 million budget cut. Since then, there has been no answer as to what they are basing their budget cuts on.\nThere is also the matter of having tuition increased or having it exempted. 70% of the students are recipients of the Pell Grant, allowing them to attend the university at low or no cost. With Puerto Rico’s economy in crisis and a poverty rate of 46% it is important for many of these students, some being the first in their family, to attend a higher education institution as this will guarantee them a higher salary and more employment opportunities in and outside the archipelago. The auditing of the debt has been asked as a matter of transparency. As mentioned before, the budget cuts aren’t based on any study made by the Oversight Board. The government has insisted that the university do its part in paying the debt yet the students have asked that before doing so, they see where the borrowed money went.\nThe students of the University of Puerto Rico have decided to take a stance against the government’s attempt to cut education and to pay an unaudited debt as the people of Puerto Rico continue to live in possibly worsening conditions.

{"query": "Motorists urged not to panic buy fuel; ‘10 days’ to save Christmas – as it happened The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated what happens when the government fails to deliver on what Americans expect and need. Americans believe that it is the responsibility of the U.S. government to keep its people safe and sound, invest for the future, and be good stewards of taxpayer dollars and well-regulated markets—in short, to create a fair system that gives everybody a shot at the American dream. Sadly, in recent years, the federal government has failed on most of these issues, as the concurrent public health crisis and deep recession wreak massive hardship for millions of families.1 Unsurprisingly, Americans are frustrated across the board, with 69 percent stating in a recent poll that the United States is on the wrong track when it comes to fiscal policy management.2 Budgets reflect values. And the Trump administration has shown its cards clearly regarding the federal budget. Three years ago, rather than actually address the dual problems of slow productivity growth and massive economic inequality, the administration, then-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI), and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) rammed through Congress a massive tax cut, one that was heavily weighted toward the largest corporations and the wealthy. The legislation, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), was packed with budget gimmicks intended to mask its significant costs.3 In the process, it kept income and wealth inequality at record high levels and left unaddressed many issues that plagued families long before the pandemic: low wage growth, high health care and education costs, and growing indebtedness. Yet today, in the face of a devastating pandemic, many of the same congressional leaders are delaying the next legislative package of economically essential coronavirus relief on the grounds of the very deficits that the TCJA helped create.4 This is despite the overwhelming economic and popular consensus that fiscal policy must do “whatever it takes” to address the pandemic and take far bolder actions to build resilience in the face of coming climate shocks and systemic inequalities.5 Putting bare-knuckle politics aside, this issue brief considers how U.S. policymakers should assess fiscal policy in the era of COVID-19—and for at least the foreseeable future beyond the pandemic. In short, responsible fiscal policy in today’s economic reality may be best demonstrated by a government that serves taxpayers by investing in higher productivity, more financial security, expanded opportunity, and greater worker power; by securing inequality-reducing revenues; and by protecting the economy against likely financial, climate, and public health crises.6 The Center for American Progress’ recent research on budgets and fiscal policy focuses squarely on how policymakers can secure productivity growth, expand opportunity, and reduce inequality.7 Pursuing these goals can help create a virtuous cycle, whereby faster growth in the present, equitably shared, contributes to faster growth in the future. These investments are a top priority; when they are made with an eye toward increasing productivity growth and expanding opportunity, the stronger economy can itself make paying any interest on those investments easier. Consider the example of when doctors take out loans to attend medical school: Their higher future earnings from a lucrative career make it easier for them to pay off incurred loan debt. Investments in education, research, and infrastructure are just a few examples of taxpayer dollars that government puts toward future productivity and that yield expanded opportunity and reduced inequality. The combination of faster productivity growth and more economic equality will ultimately translate into a lower burden on taxpayers for any debt-financed investments. More people will have higher incomes than would otherwise be the case, increasing federal government revenue in the process. This does not mean that deficits will pay for themselves, but deficit-financed, well-designed investments will substantially lighten the load of the additional debt. The GI Bill that financed education for millions of veterans after World War II; the interstate highway system; government research that helped build the internet; federal research funding for pharmaceutical research to eradicate diseases and find new treatments; and the construction of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which broke the utility monopolies and lowered energy costs for millions of families and businesses, are just a few examples of investments that yielded productivity returns far beyond their upfront costs.8 However, it must be recognized that too many of America’s past investments have excluded people of color, undermining the broadly shared prosperity essential for long-term fiscal responsibility.9 Analogies to household borrowing are unavoidable tools for helping people understand financial matters, but they have significant limitations and even downsides when it comes to truly appreciating the operation of government borrowing. In particular, households often face obstacles in borrowing the money necessary to invest in their own futures, as the example of student loans amply highlights. They also have finite life spans where they borrow money to invest in education and housing early in their career; increase their earnings and savings if all goes well; and eventually enter retirement. Households typically aim to pay off all or most of their debt by the time they retire. Limited access to affordable debt and finite investment horizons mean that households cannot fully address all their needs and are left with a lot of financial risks. For example, many households, especially African American and Latinx households, end up with significant high-cost student and auto loan debt early in their careers, hampering their ability to buy a house or start a business.10 The federal government, in contrast, can borrow on highly favorable terms to finance necessary investments and has a much longer time horizon. It can thus address large, known but longer-term risks by temporarily increasing its borrowing. The federal government can borrow on more favorable terms for a number of reasons, including the size of the U.S. economy, the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency, and the role of public debt as the foundational asset of the financial system for liquidity, credit pricing, and other purposes. The federal government’s capacity and necessity to borrow are not only far larger than those of households but also fundamentally different. It can address key challenges such as borrowing and spending to counter the boom-and-bust cycles of the economy, for example, by supporting households and businesses hurt by the pandemic. It can also respond to financial, public health, and climate crises in its fundamental role of protecting people, boosting financial stability, and increasing productivity growth. When addressing federal budget matters, policymakers therefore should be cautious in using household analogies that drive questions such as, “Where will the money come from?” or “How will we pay it back?”—not because those questions cannot be asked or answered, but because the answer in the governmental context is so different from the answer in the household context.11 Protecting the country in times of national crisis—such as wars—has historically justified exceptionally heightened levels of debt, usually expressed as a ratio of debt held by the public to gross domestic product (GDP). And in fact, while wars waste a great many things—not the least of which is life—they have also resulted in productivity booms that are due in part to government investment in technological and manufacturing capacity and to productivity innovations that arise from what are commonly extremely tight labor markets during those periods.12 Indeed, the years following World War II saw the nation’s biggest boom in middle-class opportunity for workers—not including, by intentional policy design, Black workers.13 Public debts as a percentage of GDP declined as the economy grew more quickly, a reasonable level of worker wage growth and inflation were maintained, and the wealthy paid their fair share in taxes. Today, the pandemic-related economic crisis, systemic racism, and climate change all pose similar existential crises, and each demands a similarly robust response—one that increases technological and manufacturing investment and tightens labor markets by addressing the nation’s needs.14 Recent economic research highlights in particular the importance of investing, including through short-term deficits, to support workers’ productivity growth and a more equitable distribution of economic resources. This combination of faster growth and more equality could allow the nation to avoid the economic scarring that can come when a crisis dislocates workers for extended periods.15 The country is suffering from a deep and prolonged recession that is hurting families and businesses. Even though GDP growth rebounded from July 2020 to September 2020 and recovered most of the ground lost in the preceding months, people had 10.7 million fewer jobs in September 2020 than in February 2020, and the employed share of people ages 25 to 54 was only 75 percent—far below the 80.5 percent share in February and below any levels recorded from 2011 to 2019.16 Moreover, the labor market recovery is showing signs of slowing. Financially strapped households are already out of options when it comes to paying their bills. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that 15.1 percent of renters had fallen behind on their rent at the end of September.17 The widespread and lingering economic pain from the recession will eventually hurt all kinds of businesses and further slow the recovery, unless Congress quickly enacts another large and well-targeted fiscal stimulus. The COVID-19 pandemic presents precisely such a case for a robust fiscal response to save lives and prevent the kind of sustained job loss that occurred for too many workers in the years following the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession, when fiscal austerity returned far too soon. The International Monetary Fund recently praised fiscal policy for doing “whatever it takes to save lives and livelihoods” as countries go through COVID-19 lockdowns, but it continued to emphasize the importance of smart investment: When the health crisis is contained, the emphasis will shift to exiting from exceptional government interventions and to ensuring the sustainability of public finances while building resilience against future shocks and addressing preexisting challenges such as inequalities and global warming.18 In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States will need to make significant investments to support job creation in so many hard-hit communities; build small-business opportunity nationally, especially in communities of color where the racial wealth gap has left families vulnerable to the dual onslaught of the public health crisis and the deep recession; address the climate crisis and so many other problems that have been neglected for far too long; and much more.19 Empowering worker power to collectively secure fair wages would also support the advancement of responsible fiscal policy. Because unions help raise wages, they support both economic security for workers and higher productivity, both of which have positive fiscal impacts.20 More fundamentally, worker power is important because unions have proved to be powerful tools in focusing workers on their essential interests as citizens in a democracy.21 Vibrant multiracial unions have also been essential to countering the threats of racism and racial division, which are proving to be dangerously powerful forces that undermine the very tenets of the United States’ economic and national strength nearly every day in President Donald Trump’s America.22 Consider systemic racial inequality. The protests against police brutality this summer have once again laid bare how any federal government response addressing the massive inequities highlighted by the pandemic will need to wrestle with the persistent and widespread racial wealth gap. The gap between Black and white families’ wealth serves as a key example. Black households typically own a fraction of the wealth of white households. In 2019, the last year for which data are available, the median wealth of Black families amounted to $24,100, or 12.8 percent of white families’ median wealth of $188,200.23 This lack of wealth has left Black families especially vulnerable in the pandemic as they are more likely to experience layoffs24 and higher health care costs due to a greater exposure to the coronavirus.25 They have fewer resources to cover the loss of income and higher health care costs, resulting in greater financial vulnerabilities and fewer opportunities to invest in their children’s remote learning.26 The pandemic thus made an already massive economic inequality much worse.27 Federal efforts to shrink the Black-white wealth gap must be part of any responsible fiscal policy and need to take several forms. First, the federal government should do no harm and avoid a return to fiscal austerity. Aggressive reductions in public services hurt many people of color in two ways: They lose access to stable, well-paying jobs with decent benefits that are often unavailable to them in the private sector, and they lose vital services in health care, education, transportation, and other areas.28 Next, the federal government needs to address the persistent exclusion of Black entrepreneurs and inventors from federal funding for research and development.29 Third, the federal government must make direct investments in raising wealth for Black families so that they can enjoy the same economic opportunities as white families. These direct investments can include regular savings for children until they reach age 18, commonly known as baby bonds; debt-free college; easier access to low-cost, low-risk savings options; and full enforcement of anti-discrimination and civil rights legislation in mortgage and housing markets.30 Without such investments, a large and growing share of the population will continue to face much harder and more widespread financial struggles than is the case for white families, and persistent and systemic inequality will continue to hamper inclusive, broad-based growth and drive social fracture and conflict—all of which is deeply harmful to fiscal policy. Climate change’s economic impacts are similarly stark. Communities of color will be the hardest hit when it comes to the effects of the climate crisis, but those impacts extend widely across the economy and all the way to the most powerful: The risk of a climate change-driven financial crisis grows every day that markets and regulators refuse to act on climate change.31 Already, weather-related natural disasters have taken thousands of lives and cost nearly half a trillion dollars in the past three years alone.32 This year’s fire season was so intense in the West that the skies of major American cities were darkened in broad daylight.33 Farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and others in the agricultural sector are feeling the pain of nature’s punishingly fast changes.34 The necessity of an overwhelming response on climate—one focused on a 100 percent clean energy target, a worker-centered approach, and environmental justice—grows more pressing by the day.35 Indeed, precisely because there is no silver bullet, trillions of dollars in federal investments need to be deployed across a wide range of initiatives—including research and development; safe and healthy infrastructure; worker and community transitions; rural conservation and sustainable agriculture; and special efforts to target communities that have historically carried an unfair burden from pollution. This is critical to addressing the existential challenge that is the climate crisis.36 Ultimately, smart investments that enhance productivity and protect people and the planet are fundamentally in furtherance of responsible fiscal policy in that they bolster the economic, social, and environmental foundations for growth and prosperity. This is not to say that structural deficits do not pose potential economic risks over the long term. As such, policies that undermine the country’s revenue base heighten those risks. Unfortunately, the mistakes of recent years have added up. In particular, the 2017 TCJA was predicated on cut-and-grow mythology that has time and again been proved wrong. The law also ignored independent scorekeepers and relied on budgetary gimmicks, leading it to be deficit-financed and have an effective price tag well north of the roughly $2 trillion official price tag should core features of the law get extended.37 The bulk of those funds were redistributed upward, going to the wealthy and to the largest, most profitable corporations, which have used their tax cuts not to invest in job creation or workers through new economic capacity or productivity, but instead to finance share buybacks and mergers and acquisitions.38 Quite simply, the tax cuts were a missed opportunity to make productivity-enhancing investments to build America’s future.39 And while billed as tax reform, the bill left untouched some of the most wasteful tax expenditures—such as the private equity so-called carried interest loophole. It even created some large new ones, such as the 20 percent deduction for business income earned through pass-through entities, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction that actually contains incentives to offshore production, and the opportunity zone tax shelter that provides extraordinary capital gains reductions for the wealthy but few guardrails to ensure that the investment funds benefit existing populations in underserved communities.40 More broadly, greater revenues are needed not only to support economic investments in middle-class job creation, climate change mitigation, and more, but also to play a role in directly reducing inequality. A return to more progressive rates of tax on high incomes, capital gains, and wealthy estates; stronger tax enforcement, especially with respect to the wealthy; and more are all important tools to create a fairer tax system.41 Closing irresponsible business loopholes, such as the pass-through tax loophole, and reversing the tax cuts for corporations that have brought corporate revenue well below historic and international norms are equally critical to countering the extraordinary accumulation of wealth and power at the very top.42 These changes will also generate more revenue to support vital programs that many American families need for their financial security and to enjoy equal economic opportunity. The 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession laid bare the connection between the banking system and fiscal responsibility: Not only did millions of Americans lose their jobs and homes, but the public debt and the Federal Reserve System’s balance sheets both rose dramatically. Essentially, America saw the socialization of much of the private sector debt that the banking system and capital markets had created but mismanaged, while unemployment and the real economy slowdown caused more fiscal outlays and a collapse in federal and state tax revenue.43 None of this was news to experts, who for years understood that financial fragility has strongly negative impacts on employment and macroeconomic outcomes, which in turn further exacerbates weaknesses in the financial system. Unfortunately, COVID-19 presents the risk of another financial crisis that requires sustained attention in order to avoid it.44 Critical funding markets broke down in March, and the Federal Reserve System has deployed extraordinary levels of emergency lending to support the financial system, corporations, and municipalities, acting in ways that even exceed what was done during the 2008 financial crisis.45 Moreover, banks remain exposed to homeowners who cannot pay their bills, to commercial real estate owners whose incomes depend on renters and small businesses that cannot pay the rent, and to other losses that may ripple through the economy. At particular risk are financial institutions and markets exposed to an increasingly highly indebted corporate sector, which includes an oil and gas industry that has struggled for years.46 If these issues are not addressed and financial risks become too large, the costs of a financial crisis fall squarely on the taxpayer, not only through the immediate draws on the federal government safety net but also through the real economy implications for recessions: a macroeconomic slowdown, more unemployment, fewer revenues, and higher expenditures. As the negative interaction between real economy downturns and financial sector fragility can produce unexpectedly large outcomes for employment and other macroeconomic variables, fiscal responsibility during the COVID-19 economic crisis demands a prudent approach to financial regulation.47 In simple terms, prudent financial regulation starts by ensuring core components of the financial system are regulated to take the risks necessary to serve their important real economy functions and not more. These include deposit-taking and lending for banks; securities underwriting and customer-focused trading for securities firms; and business and consumer insurance services for insurance companies. Banking organizations, for example, should not be engaged in taking high-risk, swing-for-the-fences bets on the ups and downs of the market, which do little more than fill the bonus pools of traders and executives at the expense of their customers and clients.48 All financial firms should maintain robust buffers in the form of loss-absorbing capital and high-quality liquid assets to help them weather the inevitable storms in the financial markets.49 Additionally, specific financial products and the markets in which they may operate—be they consumer loans, securities, derivatives, or otherwise—should be transparent and well-regulated to protect consumers and investors; to ensure fair and efficient markets for all market participants; and to otherwise support the maximum possible long-term alignment between those markets and the public interest, such as relating to worker empowerment, climate change efforts, racial justice, and more general environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters.50 In essence, prudent financial market regulation is a way to ensure that the federal purse will not be unduly taxed by another foreseeable and preventable crisis. To date, many of the reforms to bank capital, risk-taking, swaps, consumer protection, and more put in place by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 have helped to insulate the financial system from the pandemic’s economic impacts.51 Yet the Federal Reserve Board and other financial regulators have chipped away at the Dodd-Frank Act’s capital and other regulatory foundations in the years since its passage, exposing taxpayers to heightened risks of failed banks.52 Real-time choices made by regulatory leadership matter, too: Irresponsible capital releases for dividends or share buybacks, amazingly, were permitted to continue well into the beginning of the pandemic lockdown.53 Although the situation appears calm at the moment, continued attention is critical, as financial markets seem to be pricing in far higher losses in the corporate sector than they normally do.54 Additionally, the failure of Congress to pass sufficient fiscal support for families, small businesses, and states and local governments presents a continued risk to the financial system.55 Nor do the immediate risks to the financial system end with COVID-19. As was highlighted in a recent unanimous report by a climate-related risk advisory committee to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the already present harms of climate change, and the ensuing risks of a climate-related financial crisis, only make it more urgent that financial regulators get their houses in order.56 Key tools to address this challenge include enhanced climate-related corporate transparency, including the emissions financed by the financial sector; bank stress tests and capital regulation; transparency regarding ESG approaches by asset managers and asset owners; and a range of tools to promote the clean energy transition and small-business resiliency.57 Despite all the mistakes and wastefulness of recent years, America retains extraordinary fiscal advantages. The dollar remains the global reserve currency, and U.S. debt forms the foundation of the financial system and central banks around the world. In fact, in an era of low inflation and secular growth challenges, fiscal capacity may be far more robust than previously fathomed.58 But that does not mean it should be wasted. Instead, America’s taxpayer dollars should be deployed to create jobs, boost productivity, and address long-term challenges—and in doing so, secure America’s economic growth, social inclusion, and, indeed, fiscal strength. Paired with an approach to revenues that reduces inequality and a prudent approach to financial regulation, this would be a truly different path forward than the reckless one that America has been traveling—because at the end of the day, a responsible approach to fiscal policy means having a government that is accountable to, investing in, and faithfully protecting the American people.

{"query": "REACT-EU: € 4.7 billion to support jobs, skills and the poorest people in Italy This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: Federal Reserve eyes 2022 rate rise Marc FilippinoGood morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, September 23. And this is your FT News Briefing.  The Federal Reserve’s timeline for raising interest rates seems to be inching closer. And a US state department adviser defends the new security pact with the UK and Australia. Meanwhile, some big names are lining up behind a former Treasury secretary’s private equity fund. Plus, market analysts are debating whether the crisis at one of China’s biggest property developers could wreak havoc on global markets. The FT’s James Kynge reminds us that China is not a free market financial system. James KyngeThe government in Beijing says to the banks, OK, I need you to stop bailing out a certain property developer. Those banks cannot but follow the orders of the central government. Marc FilippinoI’m Marc Filippino, and here’s the news you need to start your day. [MUSIC PLAYING] The Federal Reserve meeting yesterday was a bit of a doozy. James Politi It was really quite important, possibly the most important meeting of the year. Marc FilippinoThat’s the FT’s Washington bureau chief James Politi pretty much summing it up. He said the Fed signalled it’s ready to start slowing its $120bn a month asset purchases. That’s the bond-buying programme to support the US economy during the pandemic. He also said the Fed’s starting to contemplate interest rate increases starting next year. James Politi The takeaway is that the Fed believes that the economy is sort of strong enough that it can live without massive monetary support. So it’s sort of brushing away some of the concerns about the Delta variant on the US recovery. It’s confident that sort of the fiscal policy environment will be conducive to stronger and more sustainable growth. And it shows the inflationary concerns that have flared up this year are not expected to deliver a sort of massive blow to the economy either. The Fed is confident that inflation will be transitory. It will start to raise interest rates maybe sooner than it had anticipated, but it does not expect any kind of stagflation scenario. Marc FilippinoSo, James, I got to ask, considering all the news that came out of yesterday, why were the markets so calm? The S&P was up just shy of a per cent, but usually markets hate the prospect of rate increases. They love low rates because it means cheap money sloshing around the economy. So, you know, what gives? James PolitiI think that, first of all, the idea of a tapering timeline beginning in November had been amply telegraphed, really, by the Fed and other Fed officials in the last few weeks. So that was expected. And on the interest rate increases, I think it’s true that it was a bit of a surprise to see the split, the sort of nine to nine split on the FOMC between those who believe the first interest rate increase will happen next year and those who think it will happen in 2023. I think that was a bit of a surprise, but I think markets and investors and economists are gradually becoming more accustomed to a slightly more hawkish Federal Reserve. Marc FilippinoThat was the FT’s Washington bureau chief James Politi.  Former US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin just landed a big investment from SoftBank. Japan’s tech conglomerate has invested an undisclosed sum of money in Mnuchin’s new private equity fund. The fund’s worth two and a half billion dollars and it’s called Liberty Strategic Capital. SoftBank will join another big backer, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. A source told the FT that SoftBank’s move to invest in Mnuchin’s Liberty Strategic Capital was influenced by the Saudi fund, which is administered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. [MUSIC PLAYING] The big story in the markets this week has been the financial crisis and one of China’s biggest property developers, Evergrande. One of the things the saga illustrates is just how huge a role property has played in China’s economic growth story. The building boom has been extraordinary. But now, according to one eye-popping statistic, there’s enough empty apartment space to accommodate 90m people. So what are Chinese officials doing with all those unoccupied apartments (demolition sound)? They’re blowing them up. Well, at least in this case. You’re listening to the sound of a forest of half-built high-rises in south-west China crumbling after a demolition explosion. Here’s the FT’s James Kynge with some background. James KyngeThere has been the biggest migration in human history from rural areas in China to cities over the last 20 or 30 years. Hundreds of millions of Chinese rural residents have moved to the cities and therefore there had to be a big building boom to accommodate them. But the other side of it is the way that financing works in China is such that these are state-owned banks that are very reluctant to withdraw their credit from property developers, thereby causing those property developers to go bust. And so that has really been the reason why this oversupply of property has persisted for for several years now. Marc FilippinoSo, James, long-term demand is expected to fall, right? James KyngeThe Chinese overall population is not yet in decline, but it is moving towards decline. And because the number of women between the key childbearing ages of 22 and 35 is expected to decline by about 30 per cent over the next decade, people are predicting significant population decline over that 10-year period. And this means that there will be much less demand for the property that is already heavily oversupplied in cities across the country. And that leads to projections that many property developers, which have huge debts on their books, are facing a rather unsustainable future. Marc FilippinoSo, James, there’s another aspect to this. We recently learnt from our economics reporter in China, Sun Yu. He told us that local governments, like big cities, are really dependent on property sales. James KyngeThis is really the untold story, the truth about how local governments, several thousands of them all over China, finance themselves is really revealing and very much dependent on the property market itself. About one-third of the revenue that these local governments get comes from selling land to developers, which then, of course, use that land to build high-rise apartment blocks, etc. So if the developers are now in the state of facing a really lacklustre market, not being able to sell the property that they’ve built, they are not going to have the money available to buy the land. And that means that these local governments are going to face a really big hole in their balance sheets. And that will mean that they may not be able to finance the bonds that they have issued in order to build infrastructure all over China, which is another big part of China’s growth picture that we can see that this is already starting to happen. Marc Filippino So do you see a broader systemic crisis looming in China’s financial system, given how huge property is as a proportion of GDP? James Kynge When we talk about systemic crisis in China, we always have to bring in the enormous power of the Chinese Communist party because basically this is not a free market financial system. If the government in Beijing says to the banks, OK, I need you to stop bailing out a certain property developer, those banks cannot but follow the orders of the central government. So what we’re probably talking about is not a systemic problem in the sense that we would perceive it in the west, ie contagion. That type of scenario in China is quite difficult to give credence to. So it’s likely that there would be a much more gentle retreat of financing to property developers. But this would be managed in a way by Beijing that would not cause the collapse of, let’s say, several property developers or several hundred property developers and thereby bring about an economic crisis for the country. Marc Filippino James Kynge is the FT’s global China editor. [MUSIC PLAYING] UK prime minister Boris Johnson was in Washington this week and met President Joe Biden. It appears to have been a pretty happy visit coming off a week after the UK and the US joined Australia to form a new security partnership to counter China. The pact ruffled some feathers, though, including those of France. Australia cancelled a huge submarine contract with France and will buy nuclear subs from the US instead under the deal. Here’s US state department counsellor Derek Chollet with a little bit of context.

South Korea has joined NASA's moon-exploration coalition.  South Korea became the 10th country to sign the Artemis Accords , a set of principles laying out the responsible exploration of the moon, on May 24 during a ceremony in Seoul. The Accords take their name from NASA's Artemis program , which aims to establish a sustainable human presence on and around the moon by the end of the 2020s. \"I am thrilled the Republic of Korea has committed to the Artemis Accords. Their signature demonstrates the strong momentum worldwide in supporting our moon-to-Mars exploration approach,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement .

(Image credit: Korea Aerospace Research Institute) The United States, Australia, Canada, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates had all earlier signed the Accords, while South Korea became the first country to sign up during the administration of President Joe Biden. South Korea's interest in the moon has grown greatly in recent months, with South Korean president Moon Jae-in declaring in March that the East Asian nation aims to send its own lander to the moon by 2030. Under the plans, the Republic of Korea, the official name for South Korea, would use a domestically developed rocket to launch the robotic lunar lander, SpaceNews reported . \"We will actively push for challenging space exploration projects that build on the foundation achieved by developing a Korean launch vehicle,\" Moon said. \"By 2030, we will achieve our dream of landing on the moon by using our own launch vehicle. The technological prowess, experience and confidence that will be gained from exploring the moon, the first step in space exploration, will provide a solid foundation for space development.\" President Moon also announced the beginning of a feasibility study for a mission to study the near-Earth asteroid Apophis .

(Image credit: Korea Aerospace Research Institute) Few details regarding the lunar landing mission are currently available, and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) did not respond to a request for comment. The country is, however, working on a three-stage liquid rocket known as the Korea Space Launch Vehicle, or Nuri. A first flight is currently planned for October this year . KARI is developing the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) for launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in August 2022 as part of the country's lunar exploration plans. KPLO will carry a 15-foot (5 meters) resolution camera, a wide-field polarized camera, a magnetic field sensor, a gamma ray sensor and space internet test payload, all developed by South Korea.  A sixth payload, ShadowCam, will be provided by NASA to observe reflectance from permanently shadowed regions to map possible water ice deposits.

{"query": "March_2006 More than one million local government workers in the UK strike over cuts to pension schemes, in an action co–ordinated by eight trade unions. (BBC)The Local Government Association (LGA) estimated that around 400,000 council workers in England joined the strike.\nThe UK-wide strike is over government plans to scrap a rule allowing some people to retire at 60, without suffering a penalty for retiring early.\nThe government argues the current rule is discriminatory and hopes that an alternative solution can be found. Transport hit\nMinisters have called a meeting with employers and unions on Wednesday to try to break the deadlock.\nImpact across the UK\nUnison, the biggest of the 11 unions involved in Tuesday's action, said there had been \"solid\" support among members and it could be the biggest stoppage in the UK since the 1926 General Strike.\nWorkers supporting the strike include leisure centre workers, school staff including caretakers, cooks, cleaners and office workers, refuse collectors, housing officers, nursery nurses, youth and community staff and tourism officials. The strike has also affected traffic wardens, housing associations, the Probation Service, the Meat Hygiene Service, street sweeping, home care, occupational therapy and other social services.\nTransport has also been hit as some workers formerly employed by local councils, such as bus and subway drivers, remain members of the pension scheme. All bus and rail services are at a standstill in Northern Ireland, and the Mersey Tunnels in Liverpool, the Metro on Tyneside and Glasgow's subway network have all closed.\nStrike action is the only option left to local government workers\n Unison general secretary Dave Prentis\nWhat is the strike about? Do you support the strike?\nIn pictures: Pension strike\nAmong the unions taking part are the T&G, Amicus and the GMB.\nUnison general secretary Dave Prentis said: \"Strike action is the only option left to local government workers to demonstrate the burning resentment and anger they feel over the government and employers taking away their pension rights, when those same rights have been given to every other public sector pension scheme.\n \"They are understandably angry at being treated like second-class citizens.\"\nT&G general secretary Tony Woodley said: \"Three-quarters of those workers are women.\n\"Tony Blair and his colleagues think low-paid women workers are a pushover. Well, he's got that wrong.\"\nUnions have warned of further action in the run-up to the local council elections in May.\nAn LGA survey of councils in England suggested that though there had been strong support for the strike in London, Liverpool, Nottingham and the North East, in other areas the numbers were far fewer - with 150 staff out of 14,000 on strike at Buckinghamshire County Council.\nLGA chairman Sir Sandy Bruce Lockhart said: \"Council workers are continuing to do their important jobs well.\"\nRule 85\nAt the centre of the dispute is the so-called Rule of 85.\nThis allows council employees to retire at 60 without suffering a financial penalty for early retirement, provided their age and years of service add up to 85. Ealing Council workers join the protest\nThe government is planning to scrap the rule for all workers in April, but the unions say it should have been retained for existing workers, and stopped only for new recruits.\nEmployers say that with increasing life expectancy in the UK, the rule means they could face a rise in pension contributions of £5bn to £6bn in the next 20 years.\nOn the BBC's World at One, Local Government Minister Phil Woolas said he hoped an alternative solution could be found. \"The question is: Is it possible to replace the benefits that members of the scheme receive from rule 85 in a different way?\" \"If the unions and the local government leaders can find a way of doing that, our role and John Prescott's role as the regulator of the scheme is to put that into place.\" But the unions insist local government workers should be treated in the same way as uniformed police, NHS workers, civil servants and teachers - who can all retire on a full pension at 60.\nUnison says nearly three-quarters of contributors to the local government pension scheme are women, most of whom work part-time and who draw an average of £1,612 (£31 a week) upon retirement. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister held a three-month consultation on the issue, which finished on 28 February.

{"query": "Jaffa riots (April 1936)The Jaffa riots of April 1936, refers to a spate of violent attacks on Jews that began on 19 April 1936 in Jaffa. A total of 14 Jews and 2 Arabs were killed during the riots. The event is often described as marking the start of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. British Mandatory authorities and other contemporary sources dated the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine to 15 April,the date of the Anabta shooting in which Arab followers of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam set up a roadblock on the Nablus to Tulkarm road, stopping  about 20 vehicles to demand cash and weapons; separating out 3 Jews from other occupants of the vehicles. The Arabs then shot the 3 Jewish men; only 1 survived.   The two killed Jewish drivers were Israel (or Yisrael) Khazan, who was killed instantly, and Zvi Dannenberg, who died five days later.The following day members of Irgun shot and killed two Arab workers sleeping in a hut near Petah Tikva. On 17 April, the funeral for Khazan was held in Tel Aviv, attracting a crowd of thousands, some of whom beat Arab passersby and vandalized property. \n\nOn 19 April, rumors spread in the Arab community that \"many Arabs had been killed by Jews\", and Arabs began to attack Jews in the streets of Jaffa.  An Arab mob marched on the Jewish-owned Anglo-Palestine Bank. The British Mandatory police guarding the bank defended themselves by firing into the mob, killing two of the rioters. This incited the mob to \"fury\" and Jews began to be killed in the streets. \n\nManuela Williams describes this as the \"peak\" event in a series of violent attacks leading up to the declaration of a general strike by the Arab Higher Committee. \n\nAccording to Aryeh Avneri, citing the History of the Haganah, the rioting broke out first among the Haurani dockworkers in Jaffa Port. [14] A mob of Arab men rampaged through the mixed Muslim, Christian and Jewish streets of Jaffa, killing and beating Jews and wrecking Jewish homes and businesses.\n\n11 people were reported dead in the first day's rioting. These included 2 Arabs \"shot by British police in self-defense,\" and 9 Jews, with dozens of others wounded, \"most of the Jewish injured bore knife wounds.  The rioting went on for a total of 3 days, it was finally suppressed by the British military. \n\nThe continuing threat of violence combined with the destruction of Jewish property and arson attacks that destroyed Jewish homes forced 12,000 Jews to flee Jaffa as refugees. 9,500 were housed by the Tel Aviv municipality, imposing a heavy financial burden on the city. Seventy-five temporary shelters were created in schools, synagogues, government and industrial buildings.    During May and June the Haganah was able to stabilize the security situation to the point where about 4,000 of the refugees were able to return to their homes.  Others found housing privately, so that by July only 4,800 remained in public refugee camps; 3,200 of these were utterly destitute.  By November, Jewish charities had placed even the destitute refugees in housing, and the refugee camps were closed. \n\nOne impact of the riot was the start of a political demand that the Jewish neighborhoods of Jaffa be separated from Jaffa and incorporated into Tel Aviv. \n\nChapter 11 of Leon Uris's bestselling 1984 novel, The Haj, is entitled Jaffa - April 19, 1936.  In The Blood of His Servants, Malcolm MacPherson writes of 19 April as the day when the Arab revolt on Palestine began, and a \"campaign of armed attacks\" started.

{"query": "COVID-19: Patients with mild symptoms may hesitate to see a doctor; experts urge public to be vigilantSINGAPORE: Many who fall sick with milder respiratory symptoms may hesitate to see a doctor immediately because they are not sure if they are really ill, said doctors and experts. \n“It's quite common for someone in the early phase of symptom onset to be unsure whether it’s the start of a cold or whether it’s just, say, a dry throat from being a bit dehydrated,” said vice-dean of research at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Associate Professor Alex Cook. \n“What would trigger me to check it out would be if I had multiple symptoms, so it’s probably an infection and not fatigue or something, or if the symptom persisted longer than a day or two. In that case, it’s important to go get it checked out.”\nThis comes after it was revealed that several cases linked to the police para-veterinarian at the K-9 unit, or the Case 59280 cluster, had developed possible COVID-19 symptoms but had not sought medical treatment.\nOn Sunday (Jan 17), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that Case 59365, a 44-year-old male Singaporean, an administrative officer who works at the same location as the police para-vet developed a dry throat on Jan 7 but had not sought medical treatment. \nA 44-year-old female Singaporean who is a family member of the administrative officer also developed a fever and chills on Jan 9, and subsequently loss of smell and taste on Jan 13, but had also not sought medical treatment. \nAnother two cases related to the cluster announced on Monday - the spouse and another family member of the administrative officer - had also developed symptoms, including a loss of taste, respiratory symptoms and diarrhoea, but did not seek medical treatment. \nOn Tuesday, MOH reported an 8-year-old male Singaporean - the child of the administrative officer and his spouse - tested positive for COVID-19, after developing a fever while in quarantine. The primary school student is the seventh person linked to the K-9 unit cluster. \nTwo cases reported on Wednesday had continued to go to work despite being ill with symptoms like sore throat, difficulty breathing and loss of smell and taste. They were part of a new workplace cluster involving four colleagues.\n\"We strongly urge everyone to do their part to reduce the risk of transmission. Those who are unwell, including those showing early/mild symptoms, should be socially responsible and seek medical attention immediately,\" said MOH on Tuesday.\nREAD: What we know so far about the COVID-19 cluster linked to the police para-vet\nSOME PATIENTS STILL FEEL WELL\nDoctors and experts CNA spoke to said that many patients with mild symptoms may not want to see a doctor just yet because they still feel well and do not want to be exposed to sick people at the clinic. \n“It takes effort to make an appointment, travel there and wait. Another reason is lack of awareness, some may think that people with COVID-19 should have fever with cough at least,” said Dr Ling Li Min, an infectious diseases physician at the Rophi Clinic.\nIn general, patients with mild acute respiratory infection symptoms often do not visit the doctor immediately, said Dr John Cheng, head of primary care at Healthway Medical Group. \n“Even in pre-pandemic times, many prefer to monitor their conditions at home first before heading to the clinic,” he said. \n \n“Right now, there are various reasons as to why some patients may delay seeking medical help. Some reasons include the fear of taking a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, the inconvenience posed by the five-day MC, or even simply to avoid going to the clinic for minor illnesses to reduce the risk of exposure.” \nBut there are also patients who visit clinics immediately when they feel ill as they would rather not risk developing a more severe infection or infect their loved ones, said Dr Cheng. \nNUS's Assoc Prof Cook told CNA: “Outside of the pandemic, it’s not unusual to ‘tahan’ mild colds or flus, to use folk remedies or over-the-counter medication, and wait for it to resolve by itself, which most respiratory infections do.” \nMaking masks mandatory and symptom screening at companies reduces the risk from people who are asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic - exhibiting a few symptoms - but continue their day to day lives, he added. \n“Obviously it’s better to reduce your activity if you know you have a symptom of cold or flu but haven’t yet gone to the doctor,\" said Assoc Prof Cook.\nThe symptoms may also be similar to regular allergies or other non-infectious causes of cough, sore throat or running nose, said president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Paul Tambyah. \n\"That is why it is best to go to the same GP or have a regular doc who will know if you are someone with a tendency for allergic rhinitis or some other cause for the symptoms.\" \nMedical leave entitlements are also a worry for patients with mild symptoms, said Dr Lim Kim Show, a family physician at Life Family Clinic. \n\"Some of them would not want to get extended medical leave because that may actually affect the medical leave entitlement for the year,” he added. \nNoting that for patients who present with mild acute respiratory infection symptoms and are asked to take the swab test, Dr Lim said doctors will issue medical leave of three to five days to ensure the patients get enough rest and to wait for the results of the swab test. \n“So that three to five days of medical leave actually do affect the decision of some patients not to come forward at the first instinct of having any respiratory symptoms,” he added.\nREAD: COVID-19: Pilot to reopen nightclubs, karaoke outlets delayed amid rise in community cases\nSTAY VIGILANT AND SEE A DOCTOR\nWhile many with mild symptoms might hesitate to visit a doctor, experts and doctors urged individuals to stay vigilant and go for a check-up if symptoms do arise. \n“I’m quite sure that, right now, most people with mild cold or flu symptoms do not actually have COVID-19, but some other infection,” said Assoc Prof Cook. \n“However, the risk is there, as in the police admin officer’s case, and while most mild COVID-19 infections will resolve on their own, there’s a real and substantial risk that it might spread to someone vulnerable who could be much more seriously ill.”\nIt can be \"tricky\" to decide when to see a doctor when the patient has non-specific symptoms, said Dr Tambyah. \nFor example, if the patient has any links to or is working in a high-risk profession in contact with travellers, they should take minor symptoms a bit more seriously and see their regular general practitioner who can make an assessment based on examination and the patient's history, he added. \n\"I think that the best approach is to rest for a day and if not better the following day, see a doctor. Of course, if one works for a company which requires an MC for even a day of rest, then there is no choice but to see the doctor on the first day and potentially get a swab and a three-day SHN (stay-home notice).\"\n“I would urge people even with mild symptoms to be tested straight away. We clearly have a problem and now is the time to stamp it out,” said Professor Dale Fisher, senior consultant at NUH and Chair of the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. \nIf an individual tests positive, this gives contact tracers a chance to find any other cases, he said, adding that unlinked community cases are “very dangerous” and need to be found quickly. \n“Of course most people aren’t very sick so it’s easy just to rest. But in the interests of not allowing COVID-19 to pick up again in Singapore, then being diagnosed is crucial,” said Prof Fisher. \n“I know most of us would not like the isolation if found to be positive but it really is for the community good. I think it’s a critical point at the moment.”\nIndividuals should look out for symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, pains, loss of taste or smell, runny nose, said Dr Ling. They may also have nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. \n“The message is any acute respiratory symptom with or without fever, regardless of severity, (they should) see a doctor,” he added. \nA loss of taste and smell are “characteristic symptoms” of COVID-19, since these do not usually occur with other viruses, said Assoc Prof Cook. \n“But it’s important to remember you don’t have to have one of those hallmark symptoms for it to be COVID-19: The symptom profile overlaps a lot with that of influenza or common cold viruses, so the only way to be sure is through a test.” \nAdditional reporting by Soon Wei Lin.\nDownload  our app  or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:  https://cna.asia/telegram", "label": [{"name": "名人生病", "arguments": {"症状": "a fever and chills", "人物": "his spouse", "日期": "Tuesday"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "3 Financial Crises in the 21st CenturyA decade after the financial crisis, the casualties of the economic near-collapse are fading from memory. But that period of turmoil permanently altered the U.S. economy and the financial system. Here are 10 common questions about the crisis and its lasting impact: 1. What was the short-term impact of the financial crisis on the economy? The crisis was the worst U.S. economic disaster since the Great Depression. In the United States, the stock market plummeted, wiping out nearly $8 trillion in value between late 2007 and 2009. Unemployment climbed, peaking at 10 percent in October 2009. Americans lost $9.8 trillion in wealth as their home values plummeted and their retirement accounts vaporized. In all, the Great Recession led to a loss of more than $2 trillion in global economic growth, or a drop of nearly 4 percent, between the pre-recession peak in the second quarter of 2008 and the low hit in the first quarter of 2009, according to Moody’s Analytics. “It was such a shock to the economic system that it unleashed dynamics that we still don’t understand fully,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, an audit and advisory firm. 2. What has been the long-term impact on the economy? The U.S. economy has largely recovered. In late August, the U.S. stock market set a record for the longest-running upswing in its history, replenishing the retirement accounts of workers who stayed invested through bouts of volatility. Home prices have also rebounded, pushing total housing wealth to top the levels seen in the pre-recession peak. Unemployment is low, at 3.9 percent in July. “It’s fair to say the crisis was a financial calamity for homeowners everywhere, but now almost everyone has recovered what they lost in that downturn,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Still, the recovery has not buoyed all consumers equally. Many workers have struggled to land jobs that paid as well as the positions they had before the recession. That shift, combined with the time spent out of work and other drops in productivity since the crisis, has led to a loss of about $70,000 in lifetime income for every American, according to an estimate from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. At the end of 2017, 4.4 million homeowners were underwater on their mortgage, meaning they owed more than their homes were worth, according to the real estate company Zillow. 3. Whatever happened to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? In 2008, the government seized control of the troubled mortgage giants as the housing market unraveled and the companies’ losses piled up. Taxpayers pumped billions into the companies, but over the past few years Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy mortgages from lenders and then package them into securities to sell to investors, have been spewing profits that feed into government coffers. Fannie Mae, for example, took $119.8 billion in taxpayer bailout money but has handed over $167.3 billion to the Treasury Department. The smaller Freddie Mac took $71.6 billion in bailout money and has turned over $112.4 billion in profits. The companies remain under government conservatorship, and there is little urgency in Congress to tackle the complicated task of determining their futures. Some proposals have called for Fannie and Freddie to be privatized, others to abolish them all together. Further complicating the fight: Some Wall Street investors say Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s profits should be going to shareholders and not the government. In the meantime, Fannie and Freddie still back about 60 percent of U.S. mortgages, and lawmakers appear hesitant to disturb the status quo, housing experts say. “There is a risk that if you get it wrong, you are really going to do damage to a market that is essential to millions of Americans,” said Michael Barr, a University of Michigan Law School professor who served in the Treasury Department in 2009 and 2010. 4. How did the crisis change the housing market? The housing market was ground zero of the crisis. The market crashed as homeowners with subprime and other troublesome loans defaulted at record levels. Home prices dropped, and millions lost their homes to foreclosure. The market has largely recovered, with home prices rising and far fewer people behind on their mortgages. Regulators have also established new restrictions on the types of loans banks could offer. “Remember ninja loans? No income, no assets, no problem? We have come a long way,” Brusuelas said. But the housing recovery has left behind low-income, low-credit-score borrowers, economists say. Rather than risk making loans to those buyers, banks have focused more intensely on those with pristine credit and buying more-expensive homes, they say. “There is pressure building to change this,” said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow. 5. Are there still “too big to fail” banks? Yes. In fact, many of the country’s biggest banks are bigger now than they were before the financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase has $2.5 trillion in assets, compared with $1.5 trillion in 2007. Bank of America has about $2.3 trillion in assets, compared with $1.7 trillion in 2007. The assets of Wells Fargo are near $2 trillion, more than double what they were right before the crisis. “If and when another crisis hits, the biggest players will be far larger than they were during the last crash,” according to a 2017 S&P Global Market Intelligence report. Some policymakers, including Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari, continue to call for a breakup of the big banks, but the idea has not gained much traction. Lawmakers considered trying to limit the size of banks while debating legislation to overhaul the financial industry but ultimately rejected the idea. Instead, the 2010 financial-overhaul law, the Dodd-Frank Act, handed regulators broad new powers to police the industry, and the biggest banks undergo the most intense scrutiny. “Essentially, too big to fail has been solved — taxpayers will not pay if a bank fails,” Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, the largest bank in the country, wrote in a 2017 letter to shareholders. 6. What ever happened to Lehman Brothers? Many point to Sept. 15, 2008 — the day Lehman Brothers, then the nation’s fourth-largest investment bank, filed for bankruptcy — as a turning point in the crisis. After galloping to the rescue of other major financial institutions, the federal government drew the line with Lehman, allowing the firm to collapse. A decade later, a bankruptcy court is still wading through the wreckage. The bank’s trustee has sold thousands of its assets and paid out more than $130 billion to settle claims against it. But 365 former Lehman Brothers employees are still petitioning to recover millions in lost salaries and bonuses, potentially keeping the case in court for years to come. “When we started out ten years ago, we faced the chaotic conditions of a global liquidity crisis and had to make immediate decisions in the ‘Fog of Lehman,’ ” James W. Giddens, liquidation trustee for Lehman Brothers, said in a statement. “It was a monumental amount of work. We are proud that we were able to recover as many assets as possible for those distributions in an efficient and fair process.” 7. Did anyone go to jail for causing the financial crisis? No major bank CEOs were criminally charged with causing the financial crisis. Federal prosecutors considered cases against some high-profile figures, including Angelo Mozilo, the chief executive of mortgage giant Countrywide Financial, but ultimately didn’t pursue them. In 2013, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said that some financial institutions had become “so large” that it made it “difficult for us to prosecute them.” Prosecutors would have needed evidence that the high-ranking executives were personally involved in criminal conduct to bring a case, said Jacob Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor and a partner at the law firm Dickinson Wright. “Many of the decisions in institutions that gave rise to the financial crisis, and certainly the design of the aggressive practices and instruments that triggered the crisis, occurred at levels well below the big-name executives,” he said. Dozens of executives from smaller banks have been prosecuted by the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was established to police firms that received bailout funds. But even SIGTARP has expressed frustration with the difficulty of prosecuting executives at the top firms. To be sure, the banking industry did pay a hefty price for the crisis — billions in fines. Bank of America, for example, paid a whopping $17 billion to resolve allegations that it knowingly sold faulty mortgage securities that contributed to the financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase paid $13 billion. 8. Is Wall Street still handing out big bonuses? Sort of. Wall Street bonuses are nearing record highs again. The average bonus payout reached $184,220 last year, a 17 percent increase compared with the previous year and the closest Wall Street has come in more than a decade to its all-time high of $191,360 in 2006, according to the New York state comptroller. Wall Street’s critics argued that excessive bonuses helping fuel the financial crisis, and Congress attempted to address the issue in Dodd-Frank, requiring regulators to establish new rules aimed at stopping executives from making risky financial bets to boost their pay and then collecting large bonuses before the fallout is clear. But the rules are years overdue and have yet to be finalized. Trump-era regulators are not expected to push the matter further. “Ten years after the crisis, the cause — venal pay incentives — remain unaddressed by Washington,” said Bart Naylor, a financial-policy advocate for the nonprofit consumer group Public Citizen. Industry officials say the proposed rules were too complicated and unnecessary. Banks have already addressed the problem, they say, noting that most bonuses are handed out over several years rather than all at once. 9. Did all the companies bailed out by taxpayers pay the money back? Pretty much. The Treasury Department injected $412 billion into banks, carmakers and other struggling companies through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. As of the end of last year, it had collected everything it had paid out in bailout funds and then some, leaving the government with a profit of $12 billion. Only about half of the banks and other companies that the Treasury Department invested in repaid in full, said Christy Goldsmith Romero, head of SIGTARP. Some companies paid dividends and interest, which helped make up for the program’s losses on some companies, she said. Taxpayers, for example, lost about $11 billion on the bailout of General Motors. A few banks haven’t finished paying the government back. But they owe a total of less than $100 million, a small portion of the money loaned out. Also, TARP carved out billions to help distressed homeowners by paying banks to lower their interest rates and monthly payments. Big banks, including Wells Fargo, are expected to continue receiving money through that program until 2023. 10. Is the financial system safer than it was before the crisis? Generally, economists agree that the financial system is safer. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act put new guardrails around the banking sector. The country’s biggest banks must now undergo periodic “stress tests” to prove they could survive another crisis and draw up “living wills” so that they could be dismantled in an emergency without requiring a taxpayer bailout. But Congress and regulators have recently begun loosening some of Dodd-Frank’s key requirements, allowing small and midsize banks to escape some of the most rigorous rules, for example. Critics warn that such efforts could make another crisis more likely. “Many holes in our financial regulatory system are now plugged,” said Aaron Klein, policy director at the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. “Are we impervious to another crisis? No. It’s human nature. Cars are safer today than they were 30 years ago, but you can still get into an accident.” Jonnelle Marte contributed to this report.

Social media fans certainly weren’t shy as they asked the reality TV personality about her life post-divorce, her kids — Camden, 9, Jaxon, 7, and Saylor, 5, whom she shares with the NFL athlete, 38 — and her various lifestyle choices.\nAfter a few softball questions about her beauty preferences, her favorite meals, her biggest turnoff in a man (“insecurity”) and how many times she’s been in love (“three”), the Very Cavallari alum revealed that she hasn’t given up on marriage despite her divorce .\nThe California native knows she “will” get married again , though isn’t in a rush “whatsoever.”\n“I’m really enjoying being alone right now,” she wrote via Instagram. “I’ve done the work I’ve needed to do for the past year and a half and I’m finally getting to a place of potentially being ready for a relationship but not quite yet.”\nCavallari is currently dating, but she assured followers that it isn’t serious.\n“In a general sense, yes, I have been,” the Little James founder wrote in one slide. “No one serious though — I’ve just been having fun. I haven’t wanted a boyfriend. But I’m currently not dating anyone.”\nThe Nashville resident’s latest confession comes months after Us Weekly confirmed that she was seeing country singer Chase Rice .\n“ It’s still very new , but they really like each other,” a source told Us in August. “They’ve been spotted around Nashville on a couple of dates, she’s been to one of his shows and they’re taking things slow.

{"query": "1964 Rochester race riotThe Rochester 1964 race riot was a riot that occurred in 1964 in Rochester, New York, United States. The African American population of Rochester grew during the 1950s and 1960s, increasing from 7,845 in 1950 to more than 32,000 in 1964, at the time of the riot. Much of that population growth came from the South, travelling north in hopes of better socioeconomic conditions. Black migrants were instead met with segregated schools, dilapidated housing, and an unemployment rate that was more than six times higher than the unemployment rate for whites.  Black residents suffered from constant public harassment and humiliation, often being referred to as \"bean pickers\" in a reference to black migrant workers in the area, as well as being denied housing throughout the city, with African Americans being funneled into the run-down Upper Falls neighborhood.  The Rochester race riot came at a time of heightened racial tensions and violence in the United States, occurring only a week after a major race riot in Harlem. At 10:00 p.m. on July 24, 1964, the Rochester Police Department (RPD) attempted to arrest an intoxicated black man at a street block party and dance on Joseph Avenue, in the Upper Falls neighborhood of Rochester. Police found 20-year-old Randy Manigault unruly and disorderly. They determined he was intoxicated and attempted to arrest him. Manigualt became combative and resisted arrest. Bystanders felt police were too forceful and started throwing bottles and bricks at police. Police then called for backup from the RPD, with a K-9 unit responding due to a shortage of other officers. Despite being against RPD practice to use police dogs on crowds, two police dogs were used to control the crowd. This use of police dogs seems to have played a part in starting the riot, with the presence of K-9 units evoking memories of violent police dogs being used against peaceful civil rights protesters in Birmingham, Alabama. [4]\n\nBy 11:30 p.m. all available officers had been deployed and were engaged with around 400 rioters. At 2:00 a.m., Rochester police chief William Lombard ordered officers to use riot weapons on the crowd. The riot had swelled to 2,000 people by 3:30 a.m. and looting had begun on Clinton Avenue, the main thoroughfare in Upper Falls. Governor Rockefeller declared a state of emergency by 9:00 a.m., with the event being officially dubbed a \"riot\" at that time. The chaos calmed during the day on July 25, 1964 before rioting resumed in force that night. \n\nOn July 25th six Black organizers, including 3 clergy members, brought Mayor Lamb a list of demands which, if met, would bring an end to the violence. These included a mayoral committee consisting of members of the Black community to oversee the police department, the deputization of \"responsible area residents\" and more resources allocated to Black businesses and workers. Mayor Lamb would not agree to deputize citizens.Meanwhile, violence had spread to other areas of the city by that evening, including Rochester's 3rd and 19th Wards. One man was killed when he arrived on scene wearing a helmet, stood in the street and was subsequently hit and dragged 100 feet by a passing car. \n\nThe last three deaths of the ordeal occurred on July 26th, when a helicopter used to survey the violence flew too close to a house on Clarissa Street, clipping the roof. The crash resulted in the death of the helicopter pilot and two residents of the house.Violence erupted in Rochester's Upper Falls neighborhood when demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails at police, who responded with gunfire. The addition of over 800 National Guard troops brought an end to the violence. \n\nPeace was restored after three days, after Governor Nelson Rockefeller called out the New York National Guard.  By the time the disturbance was over, five were dead (four in a helicopter crash) and 350 injured.  Almost a thousand people were arrested and 204 stores were either looted or damaged. \n\nA police officer, Dominick D'Angelo, suffered a cut under his eye, but was able to remain on duty, and Dick Baumbach a reporter for ABC News was shot in the face, but it only grazed his facial structure.\n\nAlthough the riot was initially blamed on \"outside agitators,\" almost all the rioters arrested were from the local area, with only 14 people arrested who resided outside Monroe County. Third Ward Supervisor Constance Mitchell stated, \"I know the kids here. I know the hard ones and the good kids. And it was the good kids in my ward who first threw the bricks through the windows. Then the adults stepped in. This community just went insane. \" This led to a reappraisal of policies and practices which had not changed in face of a tripling of the black population in the previous 10 years. \n\nAt that time, most blacks held low-pay and low-skill jobs and lived in substandard housing, and Rochester was the last city in the State of New York to implement a public housing program.\n\nThroughout the decade following the riot, the City of Rochester acquired the land blighted by the riot, leveled remaining buildings, and removed or re-positioned many of the streets.One of the first housing projects built after the riots was the Chatham Gardens Apartments, which opened in 1965.

{"query": "January_2021 Russian President Vladimir Putin signs a bill extending the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States until 2026, ahead of its expiration date next week, following talks with U.S. President Joe Biden. (The Guardian)Russian president spoke to Joe Biden earlier in the week about arms control pact due to lapse in February\n\nVladimir Putin has signed a bill extending the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the United States a week before the pact was due to expire.\nBoth houses of the Russian parliament voted unanimously on Wednesday to extend the New Start treaty for five years. Putin and the US president, Joe Biden, had discussed the nuclear accord a day earlier, and the Kremlin said they agreed to complete the necessary extension procedures in the next few days.\nNew Start expires on 5 February. The pact’s extension doesn’t require congressional approval in the US but Russian lawmakers had to ratify the move. Russian diplomats said the extension will be validated by exchanging diplomatic notes once all the procedures are completed.\nThe treaty, signed in 2010 by the US president Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, who was president of Russia at the time, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.\nBiden indicated during the US presidential campaign that he favoured the preservation of New Start, which was negotiated during his tenure as vice-president under Obama.\nRussia had long proposed prolonging the pact without any conditions or changes, but the administration of former president Donald Trump waited until last year to start talks and made the extension contingent on a set of demands. The talks stalled, and months of bargaining failed to narrow differences.\nAfter both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, New Start is the only remaining nuclear arms control deal between the two countries.\nEarlier this month, Russia announced that it would follow the US in pulling out of the Open Skies Treaty, which allowed surveillance flights over military facilities to help build trust and transparency between Russia and the west.\nArms control advocates hailed New Start’s extension as a boost to global security and urged Russia and the US to start negotiating follow-up agreements.\nRussia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, the country’s lead negotiator on New Start, said earlier this week that Russia was ready to sit down for talks on prospective arms cuts, which he indicated should also involve non-nuclear precision weapons with strategic range.\nRussia had offered to extend New Start for five years before Biden took office – a possibility that was envisaged by the pact at the time it was signed.\nTrump argued that the treaty put the US at a disadvantage, and he initially insisted on adding China as a party to the pact. Beijing bluntly rejected the idea. The Trump administration then proposed extending New Start for one year and sought to expand it to include limits on battlefield nuclear weapons and other changes, and the talks stalled.", "label": [{"name": "签署协议", "arguments": {"缔约成员大会（合同当事人）": "the United States", "协议有效期": "five years", "协议内容": "extending the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty", "日期": "a week before the pact was due to expire"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "The Looming Stagflationary Debt Crisis Efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus—particularly the closure of nonessential businesses—are having an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy. Nearly 17 million people filed initial claims for unemployment insurance over the past three weeks, suggesting that the unemployment rate is already above 15 percent[1] —well above the rate at the height of the Great Recession. However, these aggregate statistics mask substantial variation across the country. Some cities, such as New York, are already experiencing full blown pandemics and non-essential business activity has been substantially halted. In other areas economic activity has slowed less. This variation represents the degree of spread of the virus, the timing and extent of the state and local response, and the sectoral mix of economic activity. Work by our colleagues suggests that metropolitan areas dependent on energy, tourism, and leisure and hospitality are likely to suffer greater slowdowns, while those that depend more on industry, agriculture, or professional services will suffer less.   Figure 1[2] displays the sum of initial claims for unemployment insurance filed during the weeks ending March 21, March 28, and April 4 for selected states as a share of the labor force[3]. As can be seen, in the hardest hit areas, the number of initial claims as a share of the labor force was double or triple that of the least affected areas. While some of the differential likely reflects variation in unemployment insurance systems across states, this explanation is unlikely to explain the entire differential. Since, as can be seen, the states with relatively more claims include those dependent on tourism (Nevada and Hawaii) and those which have been hard hit by the virus (Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Michigan), while those with few claims have low incidence of the virus. Hence, it does appear, at least to start, there has been an idiosyncratic aspect to how states, and implicitly metropolitan areas, are affected by the pandemic. Eventually, however, a shock of the magnitude of the novel coronavirus will certainly result in a national recession, affecting the entire country to a greater or lesser degree. In this post, we examine how shocks to the economy, like the one we are experiencing now with the coronavirus, play out at the metropolitan level, with a specific focus on the unemployment rate. We use as our laboratory the Great Recession, which started in metropolitan areas that were most affected by the housing bubble and bust, but then spread nationally. In line with previous research, we find that there is persistence in the unemployment rate across metropolitan areas. Idiosyncratic shocks disrupt these persistent differentials, but over time local economies adjust, and metropolitan areas tend to re-sort back to their previous place in the distribution. Our results also suggest that negative macroeconomic shocks tend to affect high-unemployment rate areas most harshly, and that strong macroeconomic performance helps to ameliorate not only the aggregate shocks, but also the differences across metropolitan areas. As has been well documented, the economies of metropolitan areas vary in structural ways, for instance based on their industrial mix, geography, demographics, and infrastructure. These structural differences result in persistent differences in labor market outcomes, including unemployment rates[4]. In Figure 2, we examine the persistence of the unemployment rate by metropolitan area. Each dot represents a metropolitan area, and dots are color coded according to their quartile in the distribution of unemployment rates in 2006. The x-axis denotes the metropolitan area’s unemployment rate in 2006 and the y-axis the area’s unemployment rate in 2018. These are both years at which the economy was near, but not at its peak. Figure 2 shows a clear, positive relationship between unemployment rates in 2006 and 2018: lower unemployment rates in 2006 are associated with lower unemployment rates in 2018. Notably this relationship holds across the entire sample, and also within the unemployment rate quartiles. Our results suggest that a 1 percentage point higher unemployment rate in 2006 is associated with a 0.6 percentage point higher unemployment rate in 2018. Moreover, the unemployment rate in 2006 explains 44 percent of the variation in the unemployment rate in 2018. In addition to the persistent characteristics that shape the economies of metropolitan areas over long periods, idiosyncratic events specific to metropolitan areas can also have a significant impact. Examples of these types of shocks include storms, like Hurricane Katrina, which reshaped New Orleans, or technical changes such as hydraulic fracturing, which made it possible to extract oil and gas from areas where they were previously inaccessible. These idiosyncratic shocks may or may not have long-lasting impacts. Figure 3 shows the distribution of metropolitan area unemployment rates over a fourteen-year period. The figure highlights five metropolitan areas. In 2006 these highlighted areas were in the first quartile of the distribution; meaning that these areas had lower levels of unemployment than 75 percent of the metropolitan areas displayed in the figure. By 2009, these five areas had unemployment rates that were in the top quartile of the distribution that year. While it is true that the unemployment rate on aggregate was also rising during this period (as can be seen by the fact that the unemployment rates of all the other metropolitan areas, represented by the light gray bars, move up), these areas were affected earlier and by more—a function of the fact that they were hit by a specific, negative idiosyncratic shock: the bursting of the housing bubble. These metropolitan areas are located in Florida and Nevada, states with large housing bubbles, and the specific metropolitan areas highlighted experienced large drops in local housing prices when the bubble burst in 2007[5]. Like the financial crisis, the current crisis also has an idiosyncratic component. As noted in the introduction, metropolitan areas first affected by the virus closed non-essential businesses earlier. Moreover, the economies of metropolitan areas reliant on tourism, leisure and hospitality, and energy slowed quickly as travel restrictions were imposed and global demand declined. Other areas with fewer cases of the virus and those with economies dependent on industry, agriculture, or professional services appear so far to have been less impacted. Interestingly, Figure 3 also illustrates that by 2018 these metropolitan areas that faced a negative shock from the bursting of the housing bubble had largely recuperated, with unemployment rates returning to levels similar to 2005/2006. This finding is in line with Blanchard and Katz (1992) who show that state-level unemployment rates tend to recover approximately five to seven years after experiencing a negative shock to employment. Note, this isn’t to say that adjustment is automatic—indeed specific policies geared at addressing idiosyncratic shocks may be necessary to help local areas cope when they face a crisis. Figure 4 plots the distribution of the unemployment rate by metropolitan area from 2005 to 2018, with dots of different colors and sizes identifying the quartiles of the unemployment rate distribution in 2006, as in Figure 2. (We make the dots different sizes to make it possible to follow the movements in the unemployment rates of the metropolitan areas from year to year.) There are several phenomena that can be observed in this graph. One is the central tendency of the metropolitan area unemployment rates—as a whole, are the unemployment rates relatively high or low in a given year—which reflects the state of the business cycle. The second is how disperse the unemployment rates are—are the unemployment rates across the metropolitan areas relatively similar (are they clumped together) or are they spread out, with some areas having high rates and others relatively low rates. And the third is the relative position of the unemployment rates of specific metropolitan areas—do metropolitan areas that have high or low unemployment rates to start remain in those positions over the entire time period. To help elucidate these points, we also show the mean, range, and variance of the unemployment rates for groups of years in Table 1. The first thing to note in Figure 4 is the impact of the Great Recession across metropolitan areas. As the recession gained full force in 2009, metropolitan unemployment rates as a whole began to increase. Second, the differences in unemployment rates across metropolitan areas widened in years in which the economy was underperforming. And, metropolitan areas that started off relatively disadvantaged tended to experience the highest unemployment rates during the recession. This information is summarized in Table 1, where we can see that the mean, variance, and range of the unemployment rate all increase substantially during the recession from the pre-recession period. Of course, this aggregate phenomenon is being laid on top of the idiosyncratic shocks we discussed previously, in particular, the bursting of the housing bubble. For instance, the metropolitan areas that we identified as having been particularly hard hit by the bursting of the housing are among those metropolitan areas captured by the yellow dots, which rise much more than average during the financial crisis and recession. But, as the economy recovered, and the aggregate unemployment rate fell, metropolitan area unemployment rates began to converge again. Many areas that saw the largest deterioration in their unemployment rates during the financial crisis and the Great Recession experienced substantial improvement. This finding is consistent with prior research demonstrating that strong macroeconomic conditions are particularly beneficial for workers that are disadvantaged in the labor market. Notably, the distribution of unemployment rates in 2018 looks fairly similar to that of 2005 and 2006. By this we mean that metropolitan areas with the lowest unemployment rates prior to the Great Recession (the yellow dots) tend to have lower unemployment rates in 2018 and metropolitan areas with the highest unemployment rates (the purple dots) tend to have higher unemployment rates. This is just another way of illustrating the result in Figure 2, showing the persistence of the unemployment rate across metropolitan areas over time, even in the face of significant idiosyncratic and macroeconomic shocks. Metropolitan areas have high (or low) unemployment rates for different reasons. First, there are structural causes—such as average education levels or industry mix—which mean that some areas tend to have high or low unemployment rates over time. Second, there are local idiosyncratic shocks that might cause metropolitan areas to see large but typically transitory increases or decreases in their unemployment rates. Finally, metropolitan areas are buffeted by the business cycle—aggregate shocks that play out similarly, although not identically, across metropolitan areas. The current crisis in which we find ourselves is no different. Before the pandemic reached our shores, metropolitan areas had distinct capacities to respond based on their structural differences. The impact of the virus will vary across metropolitan areas depending on their exposure and industrial mix. Finally, all metropolitan areas will experience the spillovers from the deep recession as economic activity is curtailed. Policymakers should take into account these different types of shocks that are buffeting localities, because they suggest different policies. Our results indicate that policies aimed at ensuring liquidity in financial markets now and stimulating aggregate demand once it becomes safe to engage in non-essential economic activity will have a broad positive impact on economic outcomes across metropolitan areas and will reduce disparities between them. However, some localities will require more help, either because they face a particularly pernicious impact from the pandemic or because long-standing structural factors make it particularly difficult for them to weather the economic headwinds we face. Our colleagues Louise Sheiner and Sage Belz show that state tax revenues declined by about 9 percent during the Great Recession and argue that recently passed legislation—such as CARES Act and FFCRA—does not provide enough funding to prevent states and localities from cutting spending. Similarly, our colleague Matt Fiedler and Wilson Powell III make the case for increasing the federal match rate for Medicaid in proportion to the amount that the state’s unemployment rate exceeds some threshold. And the Metropolitan program discuss policies that would bolster metropolitan areas by supporting small businesses. Becca Portman contributed to the graphics/data visualization for this blog. [1] This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation which assumes all initial claims translate into spells of unemployment. We take the number of initial claims from the weeks ending in April 4, March 28, and March 21 (16,780 thousand); add the number of unemployed people in March 2020 (7140 thousand); and divide by the March 2020 labor force: (16,780 + 7140)/162913 = 14.68%. Although it is not always the case that initial claims translate into spells of unemployment, this calculation is, nonetheless, most likely an underestimate of the unemployment rate as not all people who become unemployed are eligible to receive benefits and not everyone who is eligible for unemployment insurance applies. Moreover, this estimate likely understates the number of people who have tried to file claims in recent weeks, due to limitations with the state unemployment insurance systems which have been overwhelmed. That said, there is currently less certainty about the relationship between insured unemployment and aggregate unemployment because of changes in the unemployment insurance eligibility rules. [2] Note that the ratios in this graph should be interpreted with caution. We choose the total labor force as the denominator because recent legislation has changed the types of workers covered by unemployment insurance. However, this denominator likely overstates the number of people covered by unemployment insurance. The numerator is not without issues either. As mentioned above, it is likely to understate the number of people who have attempted to file claims, due to limitations with the unemployment insurance systems. [3] Claims data by metropolitan area aren’t readily available. [4] Katheryn Russ and Jay Shambaugh show that the persistence of the unemployment rate is related to the average level of education in a county. They find that counties with lower levels of education have higher levels of persistence. In other words, areas with lower, average education are more likely to get “stuck” with a high unemployment rate over time. [5] We also examine metropolitan areas that were in the fourth quartile of the distribution in 2006 and subsequently moved to near the bottom of the distribution in 2009. We find that these areas are mostly located in places with positive energy shocks.", "label": [{"name": "金融危机", "arguments": {"受影响地区": "the U.S", "起因于": "housing bubble and bust"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

The accident involving the Seaway Strashnov vessel took place on 8 May during foundation installation at the 860MW Triton Knoll project off eastern England. News of the incident has only just emerged, with few further details available. A statement from lead developer Innogy said: “An investigation is being carried out into the cause of an accident which happened overnight on Friday 8 May, involving five people who were working on the Seaway Strashnov for Triton Knoll Offshore Wind Farm. \"At the time, all five were airlifted to hospital for assessment and treatment. Three were discharged the next day and a fourth a few days later, while one person remains recovering in hospital. \"The Strashnov and its crew have returned to port while the investigation is underway.

{"query": "2018 Chemnitz protests\n\nRight-wing and Nationalist rioters\n\nThe 2018 Chemnitz protests took place in Chemnitz, in the German state of Saxony. In the early morning of 26 August, after a festival celebrating the city's founding, a fight broke out resulting in the death of a Cuban-German man and serious injuries to two other people. Two Kurdish immigrants, one from Iraq and the other from Syria, were named as suspects. The incident reignited the tensions surrounding immigration to Germany, which had been ongoing since 2015, and the European migrant crisis. In response, mass protests against immigration were ignited by groups of German civilians. The protests spawned riots and were followed by counter-demonstrations. Chemnitz was named Karl-Marx Stadt when it was part of East Germany, from 1953 to 1990. In 2017, almost a quarter of the city's residents voted in elections for the right wing to far right political party Alternative for Germany (AfD). [1]\n\nIn 2015, the German borders remained open during the European migrant crisis, and nearly 1 million migrants applied for asylum by the end of 2016. [2] Over 12% of the German population is foreign-born;[3] some German people are suspicious or wary of immigrants, and a few hold anti-immigration sentiments. [4]\n\nAt 03:15 am on Sunday 26 August, a brawl erupted in the street of Brückenstraße in Chemnitz. According to police, the fight was between \"several people of various nationalities. \"[5] Up to 10 people were at the scene. [6] Three of them were stabbed and seriously injured; one of the three, Daniel Hillig, later died in the hospital. [6]\n\nDaniel Hillig, who was stabbed and died in the hospital, was a 35-year-old German carpenter, the son of a German mother and a Cuban father. [6] He had a seven year-old son, and a wife. [7] Hillig, who grew up in Chemnitz, was apparently well-known by many people and various political groups in the city. [8]\n\nThe two other people who were seriously injured were Russian Germans (that is, Russian immigrants to Germany). [6]\n\nAt the location where Hillig was stabbed, a large memorial was set up, where people gathered to mourn. [1][8][9]  Hillig was a football supporter of Chemnitzer FC, and some have speculated that this might have contributed to the strong fan reaction; the Chemnitzer fan club representative and local politician Peggy Schellenberg (SPD) visited the crime scene immediately on Sunday. [10]\n\nSuspects include a 23-year-old Syrian and a 22-year-old Iraqi, who were taken into custody near the scene. [11] The German district court issued an arrest warrant for them on 27 August. [12] The same day, the prosecutors said that the two men were suspected of having stabbed Hillig several times \"with no justifiable reason. \"[13] One of these suspects was named in the days after the attack as Yousif Ibrahim Abdullah from Bashiqa, and the arrest warrant for him was leaked in multiple newspapers on August 28, which went against German privacy regulations. [14][15] Abdullah was accused of stabbing Hillig five times, including the fatal hits to his pericardium and lung. [clarification needed] The other suspect was identified as Alaa Sheikhi, although his motivations have yet to be revealed. [16]\n\nYousif Abdullah has a criminal record with six offences, which include fraud and drug possession. He was most recently sentenced in July 2018 to a suspended sentence of eight months for dangerous bodily harm. [16] He came to Germany in 2015 via the Balkans and was to be deported in 2016 to Bulgaria, where he had first applied for asylum, but a six-month deadline for the deportation was missed by the German authorities. [17] His application for asylum was rejected,[clarification needed] but he won in the legal proceedings afterwards; he used an alleged love affair as the justification for this later rejected application for asylum, saying that the brother and uncle of a girl he was in love with had beaten him up and injured him with a knife. [18] Three days after the stabbing of Hillig, his application for asylum was rejected again. [18] He has also used two different identities and forged documents, during the asylum proceedings. [18] He was known for always carrying a knife with him. [16][17][19]\n\nPolice in Saxony announced on 4 September that they were \"urgently\" seeking a third suspect in the murder, Farhad Ramazan Ahmad, listing him as a 22-year-old Iraqi citizen who was possibly armed and dangerous. [20]\n\nThe festival during which the stabbing happened ended earlier than planned because of the stabbing. It was on this day that protests began in the city. [21][22] Chancellor Angela Merkel's office condemned the demonstration on Twitter. [23] German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) expressed his condolences to Hillig's family. Seehofer said that the \"consternation\" of the people was \"understandable,\" but on the other hand he condemned the violence. He also stated that the local police were in a \"difficult situation,\" and offered Federal Police help to Saxony. [24]\n\nOne German politician, Martina Renner (Die Linke), accused right-wing people of exploiting the apparent murder to their own political ends, also reminding people that in the days following the attack, the motivation was still unclear. [9]\n\nOn 31 August 2018, Franziska Giffey, German Minister for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, visited the crime scene of the stabbing, being the first member of the German federal government to do so. [25] The media asked why Merkel \"sent the Family Affairs Minister\" on such an errand. [26]\n\nFriends of the victim criticised the police in Chemnitz for their \"failure to control the three-day city festival.\" Some of the leftist protesters used slogans that criticised police for not being there when Hillig was stabbed but appearing at the protests, with journalists noting that there had been fighting before the attack at the festival. [8]\n\nThere were several rumours circulating after the stabbing, including that the attack was in response to sexual harassment, and that another of the injured men had died. Chemnitz police took to social media to stop these. It was reported that the misinformation and inability to stop its spread contributed to the strength of the riots. [8]\n\nThe politician Kerstin Köditz [de] said that the police took too long to react, and questioned how they didn't have any action or even a plan to put into action once they knew that somebody had been killed at a festival.

{"query": "2007 Venezuelan RCTV protests\n\nThe RCTV protests were a series of protests in Venezuela that began in the middle of May 2007. The cause of the protests was the decision by the government to shut down Venezuela's oldest private television network, Radio Caracas Televisión (RCTV), refusing to renew its broadcasting license and instead creating a new public service channel called TVes, which began operations on 28 May, the same day RCTV's license expired. RCTV had Venezuela's largest viewing audience, with 10 million of the country's 26 million people viewing its shows and soap operas. [1]\n\nOn 11 April 2002, supporters and opponents of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez clashed near the Miraflores Palace, resulting in a shootout at the Llaguno Overpass between government supporters and the Metropolitan Police of Caracas. A sector of the Armed Forces asked for Chávez's resignation, holding him responsible for the ensuing massacre during the march. [2][3] Commander of the Army Lucas Rincón Romero reported in a nationwide broadcast that Chávez had resigned his presidency,[2] a charge Chávez would later deny. Chávez was taken to a military base while Fedecámaras president Pedro Carmona was appointed as the transitional President of Venezuela,[2] following protests and a general strike by his opponents. [4]\n\nAccording to the St. Petersburg Times, RCTV excluded its news programs from its daily programming on 13 April 2002. Gustavo Cisneros, owner of Venevisión, stated that the alleged news blackout was a result of threats received from pro-Chávez demonstrators and callers who claimed to be members of the Chávez government. Protesters attacked RCTV's offices, smashing some windows and shouting: \"The palace is in our hands, why aren't you showing that?\". [5]\n\nOver the following months, and again in the wake of the 2002–03 general strike, Chávez stepped up his criticism of the country's private media companies, accusing them of having supported the coup. On his weekly television program Aló Presidente and in other forums, he regularly referred to the leading private media owners as \"coup plotters\", \"fascists\", and \"the four horsemen of the apocalypse\". [6]\n\nOn 28 December 2006, President Chávez announced that the government would not renew RCTV's broadcast license which expired on 27 May 2007, thereby forcing the channel to cease operations on that day. [7] The Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ)—controlled by Chávez allies[8]—ruled on 17 April that it is within the National Telecommunications Commission's power to decide on the issuing, renewal and revocation of broadcast licenses. [9]\n\nThe government maintained that the non-renewal is caused by RCTV's alleged support for the 2002 coup attempt. Bernardo Álvarez, the country's ambassador to the United States, described the licensing decision as a simple regulatory matter, which \"was not made based on RCTV’s critical editorial stance against the government, nor was it directed at silencing criticism of the government.\" Explaining that Venezuela wished to adopt a more European model of public broadcasting, he wrote that 79 of 81 Venezuelan television stations, 706 of 709 radio broadcasters, and 118 newspapers remain in private hands, citing a 30 May 2007 op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times: \"Radio, TV and newspapers remain uncensored, unfettered and unthreatened by the government. Most Venezuelan media are still staunchly anti-Chávez. \"[10]\n\nOn 17 May 2007, the government rejected a plea made by RCTV to stop the TV station's forced shutdown. [11]\n\nRCTV ended its final day of broadcasting with a rendition of the national anthem performed by network employees and on-air talent, followed by a shot of a pro-RCTV protest. The screen then faded to black. A few seconds later, a series of TVes idents appeared on Channel 2. At 12:20 a.m. AST (0420 UTC) on 28 May 2007, TVes began its programming airing a video recording with the national anthem, performed by a large choir clad in Venezuelan colours and full sized orchestra led by the famous young Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel. After some network promos, TVes switched to an auditorium, where station president Lil Rodríguez gave a speech to a crowd of Chávez supporters. On 24 May, the Supreme Court ordered RCTV to stop broadcasting as soon as its license expired and approved the government's takeover of all of its equipment and stations, though it would review the station's appeal of the decision. Chávez announced plans to start broadcasting a public service channel, TVes, using the infrastructure that belonged to RCTV. [12] According to the ruling by the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal of Justice, all RCTV broadcast equipment was to be temporarily controlled by TVes. [13] On 25 May, the Venezuelan government sent troops to RCTV installations to take control of their equipment. [14]\n\nThousands of protesters marching both against and in support of the government's decision remained on the streets in Caracas. On 19 May 2007, 30,000 protesters gathered in Caracas protesting the government's decision two days earlier that rejected a plea made by RCTV to stop the TV station's forced shutdown. Other marches took place in Maracaibo and Valencia. [11] On 21 May 2007, hundreds of journalists and students marched in Caracas carrying a banner reading \"S.O.S. Freedom of Expression. \"[11] A few days later, on 25 May 2007, university students from the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello, the Universidad Simón Bolívar and the Universidad Central de Venezuela protested against the government's intentions. [15][16] On 26 May, tens of thousands of protesters marched in support of RCTV to their headquarters. [14]\n\nThousands of protestors marched in the streets of Caracas on 27 May for and against RCTV. In the evening, demonstrations in front of Conatel, the National Telecommunications Commission, became violent, with protestors throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. [17] At least eleven police officers and one protestor from the incident at Conatel,[18][19] as well as three students and one police officer from a separate protest at Brión plaza in Caracas, have been reported injured. [20][21] Twenty other students at Brión plaza were treated for tear gas inhalation. [20][21]\n\nIn the afternoon and evening of 29 May, protests in Caracas and Chacao became violent, with protesters in Chacao blocking Avenida Francisco de Miranda. At least seventeen people have been reported by Globovision to be injured on 29 May. [22] The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights petitioned the Venezuelan government for information about arrested and injured protestors; though the Venezuelan government did not provide the information, saying it would violate the confidentiality of adolescents involved. [23]\n\nOn 2 June, tens of thousands marched through Caracas to support President Chávez's decision.

[30] However, Secretary Insulza also stated that it was up to the Venezuelan courts to solve this dispute[31] and that he believed that this was an administrative decision.

(BBC) (The Washington Post) (Bangkok Post)[permanent dead link] (The Sydney Morning Herald)Fiji has jailed eight men for between three and seven years for attempting to kill the country's military leader, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, in 2007.\nSentencing the men, Justice Paul Madigan said had the men's plot succeeded the consequences for the Pacific nation were \"unthinkable\". But critics have said the men did not have a fair hearing in court. Cmdr Bainimarama seized power in Fiji in a 2006 coup and has said elections can only be reinstated in 2014. The eight men were arrested in November 2007 over the alleged plot against Cmdr Bainimarama and four senior military and cabinet officials. Justice Madigan said Fiji had been in \"a very fragile state\" at the time of the plot. \"Had this plot succeeded, the consequences are unthinkable,\" the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying. \"There has been no evidence before this court of any thought given to the fate of the average Fijian should the country be suddenly rid of its president, prime minister and army. \"The plans of the accused were totally self-serving, thoughtless and greedy.\" Elections on hold\nThe longest sentences were given to indigenous leader and former politician, Ratu Inoke Takiveikata and businessman Sivaniolo Naulago. New Zealander Ballu Khan was also arrested in 2007, but had charges against him dropped. He said the men had never plotted to kill the leaders. \"We are dealing with Fijian judiciary here. It's not an independent judiciary,\" Mr Khan told Radio New Zealand. \"None of them should be going to jail, they should have never been tried in the first place. The military people should have been in the dock and being charged.\" Mr Bainimarama became interim prime minister of Fiji in 2007 and pledged to hold elections within two years. But he has since said constitutional reforms are needed and he not now call elections until 2014.

Now it’s Caeleb Dresse l’s turn.\nDressel won the race in a blazing 49.45 seconds on Saturday in Tokyo, nabbing his third gold medal of the Summer Games and breaking his own world record by .05 seconds.\nKeeping to himself in a corner of the ready room before the race, Dressel didn’t sit in the chair reserved for him, choosing to stand off to the side. A self-described “loner” and “weirdo,” Dressel prefers not to talk to many people at meets, but talked to himself as he walked onto the deck to cheers from his fellow Team USA swimmers. It’s an approach that’s worked well for him. The only swimmer who was under 50 seconds in qualifying, Dressel led the race from the start, holding off rising star Kristof Milak of Hungary, who won gold in the 200-m butterfly earlier in Tokyo. Dressel, however, owns the 100-m distance, and popped off the blocks with one of the fastest reactions times of .60 seconds. Dressel hit the wall at 50 m in 23.0, and continued his blistering pace through the finish.\nSince he’s arrived in Tokyo, Dressel has been closing in on his own world record, which he set at the 2019 world championships; he set an Olympic record in the semifinals in Tokyo and shaved 0.03 more off that time to set the new world record in the final. It’s the first world record for an American swimmer in Tokyo, and only the second individual world record set at this Olympics (the other was set by South Africa’s Tatjana Schoenmaker in the women’s 200-m breaststroke ).\nDressel now owns the five fastest times in the event. That’s no small feat given that the record he broke in 2019 belonged to Phelps, who was the first to break the 50-second barrier at the world championships in 2009, which Phelps swam in a type of fast suit that is no longer allowed in competition. Dressel’s time puts him in the company of other great American champions in the event, from Phelps to Ian Crocker, Pablo Morales and Mark Spitz, each of whom contributed to faster and faster races that set the stage for Dressel’s impressive time.\nThe gold is the second individual one for Dressel, who also claimed the 100-m freestyle title in Tokyo. His third gold medal in Tokyo came as part of the 4×100-m freestyle relay team alongside Blake Pieroni, Bowen Becker and Zach Apple.\nDressel has one more individual final, the 50-m freestyle, on the last day of the swimming competition in Tokyo. In his semifinal for the event, which he swam not long after winning the 100-m, Dressel recorded a time of 21.42 seconds—the fastest of any swimmer.", "label": [{"name": "打破历史记录", "arguments": {"打破纪录者": "Tatjana Schoenmaker", "打破纪录项目": "women’s 200-m breaststroke", "地点": "Tokyo", "成绩": "49.45 seconds", "日期": "Saturday", "前纪录保持者": "his own"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

Additionally, Boyette resigned on January 24th after the tweets were posted the day before. (AP)HONOLULU (AP) — The chairperson of the Hawaii Republican Party has resigned after a senior party member used an official Twitter account to send tweets defending adherents of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Shirlene Ostrov stepped down “to allow the party to recover from the controversy and focus on finding excellent candidates and fighting for policies that improve the quality of life for Hawaii’s hardworking families,” the party said in a statement. Her resignation took effect Sunday. Ostrov said the party has been “redefining itself” since President Joe Biden was inaugurated. “We have a stark but important choice to make: either we rededicate ourselves to our Constitution and continue to defend and uphold our best American institutions and traditions or we get distracted by conspiracy theories and social media wars,” the statement quoted her as saying. Edwin Boyette, who had served as the state party’s vice chairman for communications, resigned on Jan. 24, one day after posting the tweets on the Hawaii GOP account. “We should make it abundantly clear — the people who subscribed to the Q fiction, were largely motivated by a sincere and deep love for America. Patriotism and love of County (sic) should never be ridiculed,” said one of the tweets, which were later deleted. QAnon followers advocate a conspiracy theory rooted in the baseless belief that former President Donald Trump was fighting deep state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals operating a child sex trafficking ring. Some QAnon believers were among the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as lawmakers were counting Electoral College votes validating Biden’s victory.\nOstrov served as chairperson for four years. In 2016, the retired Air Force colonel was defeated by former Democratic Rep. Colleen Hanabusa in the special election to serve out the remaining term of U.S. Rep. Mark Takai after his death. As chairperson, she had mixed success trying to boost the number of Republicans in the state Legislature, which is dominated by Democrats.\nRep. Val Okimoto, a Republican who represents the Honolulu suburb of Mililani in the state House, said Ostrov’s resignation was necessary for the future of the party and “a crucial part” of her taking responsibility for what happened on the party’s social media account. “It is high time we become the party of Lincoln and not a party on the fringe. Hawaii deserves better than that. It deserves a functioning two-party system,” Okimoto said in an emailed statement. “It deserves a Republican Party that fights for the people’s best interests instead of fighting between themselves.”\nFellow Republican state Rep. Bob McDermott said Ostrov worked hard and did a good job but she made the right decision to get a fresh start. Neither Ostrov nor Boyette returned messages to The Associated Press on Monday seeking comment. Republicans lost one of their five seats in the state House in the November general election, leaving them with just four out of the 51 seats in the chamber. The party holds one of the 25 seats in the state Senate. The party’s first vice chairperson, Boyd Ready, will serve as acting chairperson. The party will elect a new chairperson and executive committee in May. The party’s statement said Ostrov invigorated the Hawaii GOP, bringing in national resources to help candidates and presided over a 60% increase in party members in 2020. Ostrov will continue to serve on the party’s executive committee as immediate past chair and will help party efforts to elect more Republicans.", "label": [{"name": "辞职-免职", "arguments": {"职位": "chairperson of the Hawaii Republican Party", "辞职者": "Shirlene Ostrov", "辞职原因": "to allow the party to recover from the controversy and focus on finding excellent candidates and fighting for policies that improve the quality of life for Hawaii’s hardworking families", "日期": "Sunday"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

More than 7,000 personnel from nine countries and NATO are taking part in the exercises codenamed \"African Lion\", which kicked off on June 8, according to US Africa Command (Africom). The manoeuvres, due to conclude on Friday, have seen rockets fired near Western Sahara, navy boats patrol off the coast of Spain's Canary Islands and air forces conduct training exercises. \"African Lion is US Africa Command's largest exercise,\" Africom said on its website, adding \"the training is focused on enhancing readiness for US and partner nation forces.\" Moroccan Prime Minister Saad-Eddine El Othmani said in a tweet ahead of the exercises that the event \"marks the consecration of American recognition of the Moroccan Sahara\". But the US take on the exercises differed. \"Exercise locations are spread mainly across Morocco, from Kenitra Air Base in the north to Tan Tan and Guerir Labouhi training complex in the south,\" Africom said in a statement. In the past days, AFP correspondents have seen exercises, including parachute jump training and rocket fire, taking place in the desert on the edges of Western Sahara. The manoeuvres were staged some 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the Algerian desert town of Tindouf, where the separatist Polisario Front has a base. Morocco laid claim to Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony with rich phosphate resources and offshore fisheries, after Spain withdrew in 1975. The Polisario Front took up arms to demand independence, proclaiming the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 1976 and fighting a 16-year war with Morocco. Morocco now controls 80 percent of the territory, while the rest is held by the Polisario Front. Rabat has offered Western Sahara autonomy, but maintains that the territory is a sovereign part of the kingdom. Former US president Donald Trump recognised Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara last year after Rabat normalised ties with Israel, sparking an angry response from the Polisario. Morocco's armed forces, which usually keep a low profile, have praised the \"perfect conditions\" under which the joint exercises are taking place. And in recent days pictures, videos and statements have been posted on the unofficial Facebook page of the Far-Maroc (armed forces) of the military games. In one video, US Major General Michael J. Turley is heard saying that Morocco has \"one of the most modern armies and air forces and navies within the world.\" Countries taking part in the exercises include Tunisia and Senegal, as well as Britain and Italy.

{"query": "2011 Northern Ireland riots\n\nThe 2011 Northern Ireland riots were a series of riots between 20 June 2011 and 16 July 2011, starting originally in Belfast, before spreading to other parts of Northern Ireland. They were initiated by the Ulster Volunteer Force. [1]\n\nThe sectarian violence began around 21:00 BST on the night of Monday 20 June, when a large number of loyalists made their way from the unionist Mount and Castlereagh Street areas to the nationalist Short Strand enclave. This provoked a response from the nationalists. [2] The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable Alistair Finlay said that around 500–600 people were involved in the rioting. [3] According to the PSNI, the riots are said to have been initially instigated by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). [4][5]\n\nThe clashes saw various dangerous objects such as petrol bombs, bricks, bottles, fireworks and smoke bombs thrown by both sides in what police described as \"high-level, life-threatening, organised, serious and sustained\" attack by people \"hell-bent on disorder\".At one point six shots were fired from the nationalist Short Strand area followed by about five shots from the loyalist Pitt Park. Two shots hit a police Land Rover in what the PSNI claimed was attempted murder of their officers.  One officer suffered eye injuries when a laser pen was being used to blind officers.\n\nThe riots in Short Strand were described by politicians as the worst violence in the area in a decade. \n\nOn the Tuesday night, during further clashes between unionists and nationalists, about 700 people were involved. A photographer was shot in the leg by a gunman firing from the nationalist area, which police blamed on dissident republicans.\n\nBy Wednesday 22 June, discussions were held between community representatives, politicians, and loyalist and nationalist figures. The result was for both sides to police their communities to avoid further violence. [citation needed] Later that night the area was largely peaceful despite unionist and nationalist groups – held back by community marshals – being involved for several hours in a stand-off at the Mountpottinger Road end of the Short Strand until around 01:30 on Thursday morning.  Nationalist marshals intervened to stop nationalist youths attacking police Land Rovers. [7]\n\nA 20-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon and assaulting police, which was followed on the Wednesday by the arrest of a 22-year-old man from West Belfast about the rioting. \n\nA riot broke out on 1 July 2011 in Castlereagh Street and Mountpottinger Road, where the police used water cannons again to stop rioting continuing into the night. \n\nOn 9 July, loyalist rioters attacked the PSNI in Ballyclare after the PSNI removed Union and paramilitary flags from outside a Catholic church.\n\nExpected riots broke out on 11 July and nationalist rioters attacked the PSNI in the Oldpark and Broadway areas of Belfast. The Royal Victoria Hospital's new £9 million extensions was damaged. It is believed shots were fired. \n\nMore expected rioting broke out the following day in nationalist areas of north and south Belfast following the annual Orange Order Twelfth of July parades. Trouble also broke out in Derry, where police claimed people as young as ten were involved. The PSNI were criticised for their handling of the riots. \n\nOn 15 July, police in Portadown came under attack with a riot involving around 100 people. Immigrants were forced to flee Northern Ireland when their home came under attack by loyalists in a Catholic area. [13] The next day, in Corcraine, Portadown, there was further unrest and rioting.

(BBC) (Amnesty)Nigeria's security forces have killed more than 150 peaceful protesters since August 2015, a human rights group has claimed.\nAmnesty International said the military used live ammunition and deadly force against pro-Biafra protesters who were campaigning for an independent state in the south-east.\nNigeria's police denies allegations that it used unnecessary force.\nThe country's army said Amnesty was trying to tarnish its reputation.\nAmnesty's report is based on interviews with almost 200 people, alongside more than 100 photographs and 87 videos.\nAmong the allegations contained in the report are what Amnesty called \"extrajudicial executions\", when 60 people were shot and killed in south-eastern Onitsha city, in the two days surrounding Biafra Remembrance Day in May 2016.\n\"This reckless and trigger-happy approach to crowd control has caused at least 150 deaths, and we fear the actual total might be far higher\" said Makmid Kamara, Amnesty's interim director for Nigeria.\nOther victims detailed in the report include a 26-year-old man who was shot in Nkpor, but hid in a gutter, still alive. He said when soldiers found him, they poured acid over him, and told him he would die slowly. Another woman said she had been speaking to her husband on a mobile phone when he told her he had been shot in the abdomen. He was calling from a military vehicle, she said, and she heard gunshots. She later found his body in a morgue with two more wounds in his chest, leading her to believe he had been executed after the call.\nThe human rights organisation said pro-Biafra protests had been \"largely peaceful\" despite occasional incidents of protesters throwing stones and burning tyres - and one occasion when someone shot at police.\n\"Regardless, these acts of violence and disorder did not justify the level of force used against the whole assembly.\"\nBut army spokesman Sani Usman that \"the military and other security agencies exercised maximum restraints despite the flurry of provocative and unjustifiable violence\".\nThe two main secessionist groups in the south-east, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra, had committed \"unimaginable atrocities\", he said. This included burning and killing people from other parts of Nigeria and forcing them to flee, Col Usman added.\nIn the past year there has been a series of protests to demand the creation of the state of Biafra in the south-east, home to the Igbo people.\nProminent IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu has been detained without trial since October 2015, with the government defying a court order to release him.  Analysis: Martin Patience, BBC News, Lagos\nThe mention of Biafra continues to trigger powerful emotions in Nigeria - and memories of the country's darkest chapter.\nIn 1967, nationalists attempted to create the independent state of Biafra in the south-east. It was to be a homeland for the Igbo people, one of the country's largest ethnic groups. But the bid for independence plunged the nation into a three-year civil war that killed at least a million people.\nAlmost 50 years on and the bitterness of that period still lingers. Many Igbos claim they are still being punished for the conflict.\nIn the past year that anger has manifested itself in a younger generation who have staged a wave of protests, fuelled, in part, by high unemployment and anger about official corruption - issues that are hardly unique to the Igbos.\nBut IPOB appears to have gained momentum after the Nigerian authorities detained Mr Kanu, accusing him of treason.", "label": [{"name": "武装冲突", "arguments": {"攻击者": "Nigeria's security forces", "地点": "the south-east", "人员伤亡": "killed more than 150 peaceful protesters", "日期": "since August 2015", "武器与装备": "live ammunition", "目标": "pro-Biafra protesters"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

Get Me Out Of Here! star will be signing off a huge bill as he is reportedly paying for 100 guests to stay at a £1,000 per night hotel at his nuptials     Alex Jones Calls Out Ant McPartlin Over Cameraman Faux Pas  Ant McPartlin will be looking at an even higher bill than anticipated following his wedding as he is reportedly shelling out a fortune to ensure his close friends can all attend his big day. The 45-year-old television host is due to become a husband for the second time when he ties-the-knot with 43-year-old PA Anne-Marie Corbett next weekend. And it sounds like Ant won’t be sparing any expense as he is reportedly planning to fork out over £100,000 on hotel bills to cover friends and family who want to attend. While it is possible the bill could soar even higher, if the lucky guests opt to send room service costs to the TV star as well. Details of Ant McPartlin and Anne-Marie Corbett's upcoming wedding suggest the TV host will pay a fortune so his guests can stay at a luxury hotel  A source whispered to the Mail on Sunday: “a grand stately home-turned-hotel in Hampshire will host a star-studded reception for Ant and his fiancee Anne-Marie Corbett on August 6 and 7.“ The report goes on to claim: “Ant is paying for 100 friends to stay at £1,000 per night and has told them to send the spa bill to his £5,000 per night honeymoon suite.” While the report also states that the accommodation for the big even is: “more expensive than The Ritz.” A report has suggested Ant will pay for 100 guests to stay at a £1,000 per night hotel on his big day ( Image: Javier Garcia/REX/Shutterstock) The reports of a high-cost wedding is at odds with previous reports which suggested the Saturday Night Takeaway star – who has been engaged to Anne-Marie since last Christmas – was hoping for something low-key. Reports last month suggested the pair were keeping the guest list to their closest friends and family members, with Ant’s TV partner, Declan Donnelly, acting as best man at a low-key wedding. A source previously said: “Neither of them want the razzmatazz of a showbiz wedding\" and that Ant and Anne-Marie were aiming to avoid the “glare of the spotlight”. Declan Donnelly is to fulfil Best Man duties at Ant's wedding next weekend  The freshly leaked plans, however, hint at a far more lavish event than previously expected. Last year, it was reported Ant had handed over more than half his personal fortune to first wife, Lisa Armstrong, following their bitter divorce. The TV host had married the 44-year-old make-up artist in 2006 – before he brutally walked away from their marriage after Lisa stood by him through drink and drug struggles. Ant and Dec set to launch 'life-changing game show with unique twist' Reports in January last year claimed Ant had given Lisa – who he confessed back in 2017 he had put “through hell” before he confronted his addiction problems by entering rehab – £31 million of his £50 million fortune. Ant’s personal and professional life were rocked as his marriage collapsed as he was involved in a drink-drive incident March 2018. With his second marriage now on the very near horizon, Ant has already braced himself for a future of happiness with a stag do. Ant's 11-year marriage to Lisa Armstrong collapsed in 2018  Back in June, the star rounded up 15 close pals – including best man, Dec – for a round of gold at Bearwood Lakes golf course in Sindlesham, Berks, as he enjoyed an alcohol-free bachelor party.

{"query": "President Eisgruber’s 2021 Commencement Address “Together, Six Feet Apart”President Christopher L. Eisgruber applauds as he looks out on the crowd from the Commencement stage before his address “Together, Six Feet Apart.”\nPresident Christopher L. Eisgruber’s address “Together, Six Feet Apart,” as prepared for delivery at Princeton University’s Commencement ceremony on May 16, 2021. \nTradition allows the Princeton president to share a few thoughts each year with our graduating students at Commencement. I regard that as a great privilege in any year, but especially so in this one, when all of you have persevered valiantly and brilliantly to overcome unprecedented challenges.\nBy completing your studies amidst this awful pandemic, you have distinguished yourselves even by the standards of this University’s long and illustrious history. And in so doing, you have earned the right to participate in this unique and memorable Commencement ceremony, a ceremony that, I submit to you, provides a surprisingly apt metaphor for the past year.\nWe are together, gathered through creative planning, technological assistance, the tireless work of many people, and a fierce determination to mark with physical presence this important moment in your lives. And yet as we are together, we are also apart, masked, separated by carefully marked six-foot intervals, and denied the joyous embraces that we would ordinarily exchange on graduation day.\nSuch combinations of separation and sharing have permeated the last fifteen months. The separation is obvious. We have endured quarantines and lock-downs. We have learned the term “social distancing,” which — hard though this is to believe — almost none of us had heard two years ago. We have had to give up communal dining, large events, small parties, and interpersonal contact of many kinds. We have met and learned through video conferencing rather than in person.\nThe sharing may be less obvious than the separation but it is equally real. It begins with the separation itself, and, more generally, with losses that people throughout the world have endured over the past year. The losses inflicted by COVID-19 have undoubtedly differed significantly from person to person. They have also differed across racial and economic groups, reminding us once again of the need to dedicate ourselves to achieving genuine social justice, not only in this country but around the world.\nWe should recognize these disparities while also recognizing that in real and meaningful ways we have shared the anxieties and burdens of this pandemic with people not only throughout this stadium, or this country, but across social divisions, international borders, and, indeed, vast continents. We fight a plague without boundaries, and our experience informs connections we feel with those suffering from the terrible outbreaks afflicting India, South America, and other parts of the globe.\nTo take another, smaller piece of this phenomenon: you now share with other graduating college students throughout the world this year a parallel experience of disruption, constraint, challenge, persistence, and achievement in response to this pandemic. Rarely, if ever, has humanity experienced such durable and unfamiliar forms of loss so widely and simultaneously.\nThe last year has also involved sharing in a second sense. Though we have been unable to interact in person, we have connected online in ways that most of us would not have thought possible, and indeed that would not have been possible even a few years ago. Most of us are thoroughly Zoomed-out and eager to return to physical forms of togetherness, but I doubt that any of us will abandon entirely our new virtual mechanisms of communication.\nWe may perhaps find some wisdom about these newest aspects of human community by considering very old ideas about the topic. Two millennia ago, Aristotle observed that people must cooperate with one another because they cannot otherwise satisfy their most basic physical needs. But, he noted, once people are forced together by their physical needs, they inevitably begin discussing and pursuing ideas about human flourishing. His insight was that because we must make and break bread together, we must form a common good together. \nAs this year’s countless Zoom calls vividly illustrate, human technology has transformed, if not diminished or severed, this connection between the physical and intellectual realms of human activity. We can now interact politically, academically, artistically, and socially without ever being in the same room, the same state, or even the same country.\nWhat technology made possible, the pandemic made compulsory. For most of this past year, we were present to one another in only two dimensions, as flattened figures on screens, while our three-dimensional bodies inhabited vastly different spaces. We shared an emaciated world.\nIt is not enough. The fractious, irritated, angry state of our national politics testifies to that fact.\nSo too, more poignantly, does our presence in this stadium today. We could have deployed technological machinery to produce a whiz-bang virtual Commencement, which you could have watched from the comfort of your homes. We concluded — with your vigorous encouragement — that it would be better to sit in this cavernous stadium, arrayed across a giant field and surrounding bleachers, together, six feet apart.\nWe lose an essential dimension of the human when we cannot be together physically. If indeed people must forge a common good because we need to make and break bread together, the pandemic suggests that something like the reverse is also true.\nSimply put, our long, unwelcome separation teaches us this: to forge a common good together, we must break bread together. We must, in other words, relate to one another not just as disembodied intellects, interests, or ideologies, or as faces in Zoom boxes, but also as real, three-dimensional people who share basic needs and a common humanity.\nI hope you will bear that idea in mind as you venture into this strange, uncertain world post-Princeton and post-pandemic. I also hope that you will find ways to break bread and reconnect not only with one another but also with people far outside your own social circles. As the political philosopher Danielle Allen ’93 has urged in a passage that riffs on Aristotle, we must find ways to convey “the techniques and expertise of friendship” into “the rivalrous realm of politics.”\nWe must all recover, renew, and reinvigorate the genuinely human forms of connection so missing from our world over the last year and all too absent, even before the pandemic, from our country’s conversations about America’s common good. As you venture forth beyond this campus, I hope that you will seize the opportunity to build the genuine community that we so urgently need.\nThe journey that commences today will take you into a new and changing world. I am confident that you are well prepared for the challenge. You have excelled here, and you have persisted through the pandemic with extraordinary determination, creativity, intelligence, compassion, and courage. We will need your leadership, your vision, and your dedication to the service of humanity.\nOn behalf of the University, its faculty, administration, trustees, and alumni, I offer you best wishes as you go forth. We hope you will always consider this campus one of your homes, and that you will return often, so that we can be together again in the future — together again, without also being six feet apart! I, and all of my colleagues, extend our sincerest congratulations on this happy day to all of Princeton’s doctoral and master’s degree recipients and to Princeton University’s Great Class of 2021!  Congratulations!", "label": [{"name": "名人演讲", "arguments": {"演讲者身份": "President", "演讲者": "Christopher L.

{"query": "2016 Sunbird Aviation crashOn 13 April 2016, a Britten-Norman BN-2T Turbine Islander operated by Sunbird Aviation crashed about 1,200 m (0.65 nmi; 0.75 mi) short of runway 7 at Kiunga Airport[1] in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea. The plane had pitched up right before the crash, and then dropped its right wing and fell almost vertically to the ground. [2] Eleven passengers (including three children) and the 31-year-old Australian pilot, Benjamin Picard,[3] were killed. Nine people died on impact, with other three declared dead on arrival at Kiunga Hospital. [4][5][6][7]\n\nThe investigation determined that an engine failure occurred mid-flight. The aircraft was loaded significantly aft of the center of gravity limit. Upon extension of the aircraft's flaps, an uncontrollable pitch up resulted in the aircraft stalling and spinning into the ground. The flight was a non-scheduled domestic chartered passenger flight from Tekin, West Sepik Province (Sandaun) to Kiunga, Western Province. The flight was under Visual Flight Rules. The flight was operated by Sunbird Aviation, a small non-scheduled aviation company based in Goroka, with a Britten-Norman BN-2T Turbine Islander, registered as P2 – SBC. The flight was carrying 11 passengers, including 3 children, and an Australian pilot, identified as Benjamin Andre Picard. [8]\n\nThe flight took off from Kiunga at 13:56 and later reached Oksapmin. Picard then reported to Kiunga that the flight was on Kiunga's circuit area and began to fly a left circuit to land at Kiunga. The weather in Kiunga, at the time, was in good condition. Picard then configured the aircraft for landing. [8]\n\nAs the flight approached Kiunga, it suddenly pitched up in a nearly vertical condition. Due to the vertical motion, the right wing stalled and the aircraft rolled to the right. It then fell rapidly, struck trees and slammed onto the ground. The aircraft impacted at a nearly 90° angle. Due to the force of the impact, the front part was crushed and the tail snapped. 9 people were killed instantly. [9]\n\nWitnesses reported the crash to the airport and subsequently located the crash site. 3 people were extricated alive from the crash site and were transported to Kiunga Hospital. However, they were later pronounced dead on arrival. All 12 passengers and crews on board were killed. [10]\n\nPapua New Guinea AIC sent two investigators to the crash site. Representative from the aircraft's manufacturer Britten-Norman was also invited to join the investigation. Initial examination of the wreckage was hampered due to bad weather condition. The wreckage was left unattended for five days due to inundation around the area. It was later taken to Kiunga on the sixth day. [8]\n\nThere were reports that the pilot of the flight, Benjamin Picard, made an emergency call to the authorities in Kiunga. Seconds later, the aircraft pitched vertically and crashed. Investigators dismissed the report. However, investigators later confirmed that the right engine had failed in mid-flight. It happened while the aircraft was approaching Kiunga. Evidences found on the right engine proved that an engine failure had occurred in mid-flight. This causing the propeller to auto feather as it was shutting down, but that the compressor was still spooling down at impact. [8]\n\nFurther investigation revealed that the centre of gravity of the aircraft had shifted significantly to the aft centre. As a result, the aircraft pitched up severely when the pilot extended the flaps. [8]\n\nIt is usual for aircraft to pitch up when the pilots extended the flaps. The possibility for the aircraft to pitch up is even greater when the pilots extended the flaps for an approach. [8]\n\nThe accident flight was aggravated by the fact that the centre of gravity of the aircraft was shifted to the aft. When the pilot extended the flaps, the aircraft pitched up. However, because the centre of gravity was located at the aft, it would be difficult to pitch the nose down. Examination on the wreckage revealed that the flaps, at the time, were fully extended and that Picard, during the stall, had made a full nose down input, to no avail. Investigators added that there was no evidence that the pilot calculated the aircraft loaded balance for the flight. The actual weight and balance of the aircraft could not be conclusively determined. [8]\n\nInvestigators later added that recovery from the stall was impossible due to the low height of the aircraft. [8]\n\nThe investigation concluded that the right engine failure caused the aircraft to lose its lift force. The improper loading of the cargo aggravated the condition.", "label": [{"name": "空难", "arguments": {"事故调查员": "Papua New Guinea AIC", "机组人员": "Australian pilot", "航空公司": "Sunbird Aviation", "地点": "about 1,200 m (0.65 nmi; 0.75 mi) short of runway 7 at Kiunga Airport[1] in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea", "日期": "13 April 2016", "航班号": "Britten-Norman BN-2T Turbine Islander", "人员伤亡": "Eleven passengers (including three children) and the 31-year-old Australian pilot, Benjamin Picard,[3] were killed", "事故原因": "improper loading of the cargo", "乘客": "11 passengers, including 3 children"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

The club booked its entertainers from Las Vegas, Nashville, Hollywood, New York, and other show-business hubs. The site had been a popular nightspot and illegal gambling house as early as 1926; Ohio native Dean Martin had been a blackjack dealer there. [2] The club had reopened under the then-current owners and management in 1971[3] and was considered an elegant venue that attracted top-notch talent and affluent clientele. [4]\n\nSeveral additions had been built onto the original structure between 1970 and 1976, creating a sprawling, non-linear complex of function rooms and service areas. [5] The resulting complex was roughly square in shape, and though it was not situated in a north–south direction, reports of the fire have tended to assign those points to points in the complex for ease of reference. Assuming this system, the front entrance of the complex lay at the southern point of the compass. Along the central portion of the southern wall, to the east of the building entrance, was a small event room called the Zebra Room. A narrow corridor to the Zebra Room's east separated it from the Viennese Room and a series of service spaces, which ran northward along the building's eastern wall. This interior corridor terminated between the Garden Room, occupying the central portion of the north wall of the building, and the Cabaret Room, which jutted out from the northeastern corner of the building. A smaller, branching corridor led from the internal corridor to an exit door that sat between the Garden Room and the Cabaret Room; to exit the building from the Cabaret Room using that corridor, a person would need to pass through a set of double doors into the main interior corridor, pass through a single door between the main interior corridor and the branching interior corridor, turn a sharp corner into the branching corridor, and proceed approximately one-quarter of the length of the Cabaret Room to the single door that connected the branching corridor to the exterior of the building. [6] This complex navigation was not atypical for the building; a number of other event and services spaces were scattered throughout the rest of the building, with some rooms leading into each other, some leading into interior hallways, and some leading to the outside of the building. A partial second story covered approximately the southern third of the building, sitting above the main entrance, Zebra Room, and main dining room; it held two more small event rooms made of six smaller rooms conjoined, collectively labeled the Crystal Rooms. [7]\n\nThough the building's frame and ceiling tiling was classified as non-combustible, the Beverly Hills Supper Club made substantial use of wooden building materials, including floor joists for the two-story portion of the complex and framing on interior hallways. [8] It was decorated throughout with highly flammable carpeting and wood wall paneling;[7] event rooms also used wooden tables and supports, as well as tablecloths, curtains, and a variety of other small combustible materials. [8] The building did not have a fire-suppression sprinkler system installed—at the time, these were not required in venues such as the Supper Club[9]—nor did it have an alarm system or smoke detectors. [8] In addition, the majority of the paths of egress in each event room led not to the outside of the building, but to a variety of narrow interior corridors and service spaces. [7]\n\nOn Saturday, May 28, 1977, the Beverly Hills Supper Club was operating beyond capacity, largely due to the popularity of that evening's Cabaret Room show, featuring popular Hollywood singer and actor John Davidson. [6] Based on its number of exits, the Cabaret Room could safely accommodate about 600 people, according to the calculations of the Fire Marshal;[6] on this night it exceeded capacity, with people seated on ramps and in aisles. [5] According to later estimates based on seating charts and memories of those present, the number of people in the Cabaret Room at 9:00 p.m. on May 28 was between 900[10] and 1,300. [6][9] Regardless of the exact number each gives, sources agree that the room was well beyond its safe holding limit. [7][8]\n\nElsewhere in the club, patrons were eating gourmet meals. [5] Later estimates place the total number of people in the Beverly Hills Supper Club on May 28, 1977, at approximately 3,000,[9] substantially more than the 1,500 people fire code allowed at the time for a building with the number of exits the club had. [6]\n\nNear the south exit close to the main bar, opposite end of the building from the Cabaret Room,[7] a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30 p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building's main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath the floor, and the group left the building before the end of their allotted time. [11] The room remained vacant from their departure until a minute before 9:00 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room's door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the Fire Department while she and others grabbed fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were not aware of it, their opening of the Zebra Room's door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a smoldering fire in the room's drop ceiling to flashover and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers were useless against the fast-growing blaze. [9] The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01 p.m. and arrived by 9:05;[11] as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles could already see smoke coming from the building. [8]\n\nAs smoke began to escape the Zebra Room and drift down the hall toward other banquet rooms, patrons and employees nearest to the Zebra Room smelled it. The employees began to urge room occupants to leave the building. However, as the sprawling complex lacked an audible fire alarm, those in more isolated rooms had no way to know that there was a fire in the building until an employee walked the length of the building alerting them. [8] Fire investigators later estimated that the fire, once it spread through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. [7] By the time busboy Walter Bailey[9] arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06 p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around 1,000 people to leave via the room's small number of exits. [8] As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those on the second floor of the building. [9]\n\nAround 9:10 p.m., power failed in the building, extinguishing the lights. Panic ensued, and even those who had been calmly moving toward exits in the Cabaret Room began to push and shove each other. [5] The situation was made even more desperate because of the three exits in the room, two were soon blocked by the fire, leaving the crowd to funnel through a single exit. [8] Employees outside the exits attempted to pull guests to safety, but the crush of bodies as those behind pushed upon those in front became so solid that no amount of strength could free most of them. [9] Many of those who escaped the crush blocking the northeast fire exit became lost trying to find other exits. The building's confusing design often led to a set of doors opening into a bar area that funneled frantic guests into a dead end. [5]\n\nFirefighters, alerted that the majority of the building's occupants were in the Cabaret Room, focused their efforts there, but even the combined efforts of every fire department in the county were simply too little, too late. [8] Temperatures in the Cabaret Room soared into the thousands of degrees and even firefighters, weary and dehydrated, were soon unable to safely attempt any further rescues. [9]\n\nWhen I got to the inside doors, which is about 30 feet inside the building, I saw these big double doors, and people were stacked like cordwood. They were clear up to the top. They just kept diving out on each other trying to get out. I looked back over the pile of – it wasn't dead people; there were dead and alive in that pile – and I went in and I just started to grab them two at a time and pull them off the stack, and drag them out...\nAt 11:30 p.m. fire command, suspecting that the building's roof would soon collapse, ordered all firefighters to evacuate the building.", "label": [{"name": "火灾", "arguments": {"地点": "Southgate, Kentucky", "日期": "night of May 28, 1977", "支援机构": "Firefighters", "级别": "the third deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history", "人员伤亡": "A total of 165 people died and more than 200 were injured"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "US Space Weather Center Issues Geomagnetic Storm WatchThe U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) Friday issued a Strong Geomagnetic Storm Watch for Saturday, saying power and communications systems could be affected after a significant solar flare was observed on the sun. The U.S. space agency NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory reported observing a significant solar flare — or \"coronal mass ejection\" (CME) — Thursday. Flares or CMEs are powerful eruptions on the sun’s surface that send tons of superheated gas and radiation into space. The observatory, which constantly monitors solar activity, captured an image of Thursday’s event. The bursts of radiation often head toward Earth, and while harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth’s atmosphere to physically affect humans, if they are strong enough, they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and other communications signals travel. When solar activity could affect day-to-day activity on earth the SWPC, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), issues a watch or warning. In this case, the center issued a strong, or G3, storm watch for Saturday, indicating the radiation could affect power systems, creating voltage irregularities, interference with communications systems or the operation of spacecraft, such as satellites. The watch is in effect from the North Pole south to the 50th parallel, roughly halfway to the equator. The prediction center said the aurora borealis — also known as the northern lights — may also be visible Saturday at unusually lower latitudes. It issued a G2 or moderate geomagnetic storm watch for Sunday. NASA and NOAA have developed the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan to help mitigate the effects of solar events. NASA works as the research arm of the nation's space weather effort, using a fleet of spacecraft that monitor the sun's activity, the solar atmosphere, as well as particles and magnetic fields in space surrounding Earth. NOAA established the SWPC in Boulder, Colorado, to monitor solar activity, much the way NOAA’s National Hurricane Center monitors tropical cyclones. Using NASA’s satellites and solar observatories, SWPC can give forecasts and warnings of solar activity that could impact the Earth.", "label": [{"name": "自然奇观", "arguments": {"奇观类型": "a G2 or moderate geomagnetic storm", "奇观开始时间": "Saturday", "预测机构": "The U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center", "奇观地点": "from the North Pole south to the 50th parallel, roughly halfway to the equator", "奇观结束时间": "Sunday"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

(NPR)                    Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — here in her chambers during a 2019 interview with NPR's Nina Totenberg — died on Friday at the age of 87. Shuran Huang/NPR\n                                    hide caption\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — here in her chambers during a 2019 interview with NPR's Nina Totenberg — died on Friday at the age of 87. Follow NPR's coverage of Ginsburg's death and the political aftermath here. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal, cultural and feminist icon, died Friday. The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas. The court, in a statement, said Ginsburg died at her home in Washington, D.C., surrounded by family. She was 87. \"Our nation has lost a justice of historic stature,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said. \"We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her, a tireless and resolute champion of justice.\" Architect of the legal fight for women's rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation's highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign. Just days before her death, as her strength waned, Ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: \"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\" She knew what was to come. Ginsburg's death will have profound consequences for the court and the country. Inside the court, not only is the leader of the liberal wing gone, but with the court about to open a new term, the chief justice no longer holds the controlling vote in closely contested cases. Though Roberts has a consistently conservative record in most cases, he has split from fellow conservatives in a few important ones this year, casting his vote with liberals, for instance, to protect at least temporarily the so-called DREAMers from deportation by the Trump administration, to uphold a major abortion precedent and to uphold bans on large church gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. But with Ginsburg gone, there is no clear court majority for those outcomes. Upcoming political battle\nIndeed, a week after the upcoming presidential election, the court is for the third time scheduled to hear a challenge brought by Republicans to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. In 2012, the high court upheld the law in a 5-4 ruling, with Roberts casting the deciding vote and writing the opinion for the majority. But this time the outcome may well be different. That's because Ginsburg's death gives Republicans the chance to tighten their grip on the court with another appointment by President Trump so conservatives would have 6-3 majority. And that would mean that even a defection on the right would leave conservatives with enough votes to prevail in the Obamacare case and many others. At the center of the battle to achieve that will be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In 2016, he took a step unprecedented in modern times: He refused for nearly a year to allow any consideration of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee. Back then, McConnell's justification was the upcoming presidential election, which he said would allow voters a chance to weigh in on what kind of justice they wanted. But now, with the tables turned, McConnell has made clear he will not follow the same course. Instead he will try immediately to push through a Trump nominee so as to ensure a conservative justice to fill Ginsburg's liberal shoes, even if Trump were to lose his reelection bid. Asked what he would do in circumstances such as these, McConnell said: \"Oh, we'd fill it.\" So what happens in the coming weeks will be bare-knuckle politics, writ large, on the stage of a presidential election. It will be a fight Ginsburg had hoped to avoid, telling Justice John Paul Stevens shortly before his death that she hoped to serve as long as he did — until age 90. \"My dream is that I will stay on the court as long as he did,\" she said in an interview in 2019. \"Tough as nails\"\n1 of 9\nShe didn't quite make it. But Ruth Bader Ginsburg was nonetheless a historic figure. She changed the way the world is for American women. For more than a decade, until her first judicial appointment in 1980, she led the fight in the courts for gender equality. When she began her legal crusade, women were treated, by law, differently from men. Hundreds of state and federal laws restricted what women could do, barring them from jobs, rights and even from jury service. By the time she donned judicial robes, however, Ginsburg had worked a revolution. That was never more evident than in 1996 when, as a relatively new Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg wrote the court's 7-1 opinion declaring that the Virginia Military Institute could no longer remain an all-male institution. True, Ginsburg said, most women — indeed most men — would not want to meet the rigorous demands of VMI. But the state, she said, could not exclude women who could meet those demands. \"Reliance on overbroad generalizations ... estimates about the way most men or most women are, will not suffice to deny opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description,\" Ginsburg wrote. She was an unlikely pioneer, a diminutive and shy woman, whose soft voice and large glasses hid an intellect and attitude that, as one colleague put it, was \"tough as nails.\" By the time she was in her 80s, she had become something of a rock star to women of all ages. She was the subject of a hit documentary, a biopic, an operetta, merchandise galore featuring her \"Notorious RBG\" moniker, a Time magazine cover and regular Saturday Night Live sketches. On one occasion in 2016, Ginsburg got herself into trouble and later publicly apologized for disparaging remarks she made about then-presidential candidate Trump. But for the most part Ginsburg enjoyed her fame and maintained a sense of humor about herself. Asked about the fact that she had apparently fallen asleep during the 2015 State of the Union address, Ginsburg did not take the Fifth, admitting that although she had vowed not to drink at dinner with the other justices before the speech, the wine had just been too good to resist. The result, she said, was that she was perhaps not an entirely \"sober judge\" and kept nodding off. The road to law\nBorn in Brooklyn, Ruth Bader went to public schools, where she excelled as a student — and as a baton twirler. By all accounts, it was her mother who was the driving force in her young life, but Celia Bader died of cancer the day before the future justice would graduate from high school. Then 17, Ruth Bader went on to Cornell University on a full scholarship, where she met Martin (aka \"Marty\") Ginsburg. \"What made Marty so overwhelmingly attractive to me was that he cared that I had a brain,\" she said. After her graduation, they were married and went off to Fort Sill, Okla., for his military service. There Mrs. Ginsburg, despite scoring high on the civil service exam, could only get a job as a typist, and when she became pregnant, she lost even that job. Two years later, the couple returned to the East Coast to attend Harvard Law School. She was one of only nine women in a class of more than 500 and found the dean asking her why she was taking up a place that \"should go to a man.\" At Harvard, she was the academic star, not her husband. The couple were busy juggling schedules and their toddler when Marty Ginsburg was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Surgeries and aggressive radiation followed. \"So that left Ruth with a 3-year-old child, a fairly sick husband, the law review, classes to attend and feeding me,\" Marty Ginsburg said in a 1993 interview with NPR. The experience also taught the future justice that sleep was a luxury. During the year of her husband's illness, he was only able to eat late at night; after that he would dictate his senior class paper to her. At about 2 a.m., he would go back to sleep, Ruth Bader Ginsburg recalled in an NPR interview. \"Then I'd take out the books and start reading what I needed to be prepared for classes the next day.\" Marty Ginsburg survived, graduated and got a job in New York; his wife, a year behind him in school, transferred to Columbia, where she graduated at the top of her law school class. Despite her academic achievements, the doors to law firms were closed to women, and though recommended for a Supreme Court clerkship, she wasn't even interviewed. It was bad enough that she was a woman, she recalled later, but she was also a mother, and male judges worried she would be diverted by her \"familial obligations.\" A mentor, law professor Gerald Gunther, finally got her a clerkship in New York by promising Judge Edmund Palmieri that if she couldn't do the work, he would provide someone who could. That was \"the carrot,\" Ginsburg would say later. \"The stick\" was that Gunther, who regularly fed his best students to Palmieri, told the judge that if he didn't take Ginsburg, Gunther would never send him a clerk again. The Ginsburg clerkship apparently was a success; Palmieri kept her not for the usual one year, but two, from 1959-61. Ginsburg's next path is rarely talked about, mainly because it doesn't fit the narrative. She learned Swedish so she could work with Anders Bruzelius, a Swedish civil procedure scholar. Through the Columbia University School of Law Project on International Procedure, Ginsburg and Bruzelius co-authored a book. In 1963, Ginsburg finally landed a teaching job at Rutgers Law School, where she at one point hid her second pregnancy by wearing her mother-in-law's clothes. The ruse worked; her contract was renewed before her baby was born. While at Rutgers, she began her work fighting gender discrimination. The \"mother brief\"\nHer first big case was a challenge to a law that barred a Colorado man named Charles Moritz from taking a tax deduction for the care of his 89-year-old mother. The IRS said the deduction, by statute, could only be claimed by women, or widowed or divorced men. But Moritz had never married. The tax court concluded that the Internal Revenue Code was immune to constitutional challenge, a notion that tax lawyer Marty Ginsburg viewed as \"preposterous.\" The two Ginsburgs took on the case — he from the tax perspective, she from the constitutional one. According to Marty Ginsburg, for his wife, this was the \"mother brief.\" She had to think through all the issues and how to fix the inequity. The solution was to ask the court not to invalidate the statute but to apply it equally to both sexes. She won in the lower courts. \"Amazingly,\" he recalled in a 1993 NPR interview, the government petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, stating that the decision \"cast a cloud of unconstitutionality\" over literally hundreds of federal statutes, and it attached a list of those statutes, which it compiled with Defense Department computers. Those laws, Marty Ginsburg added, \"were the statutes that my wife then litigated ... to overturn over the next decade.\" In 1971, she would write her first Supreme Court brief in the case of Reed v. Reed. Ruth Bader Ginsburg represented Sally Reed, who thought she should be the executor of her son's estate instead of her ex-husband. The constitutional issue was whether a state could automatically prefer men over women as executors of estates. The answer from the all-male Supreme Court: no. It was the first time the court had struck down a state law because it discriminated based on gender. And that was just the beginning. Ginsburg (left) joins the only three other women to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court — Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — in a celebration of O'Connor, the first woman justice, at the Newseum in Washington in 2012.

By then Ginsburg was earning quite a reputation. She would become the first female tenured professor at Columbia Law School, and she would found the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. As the chief architect of the battle for women's legal rights, Ginsburg devised a strategy that was characteristically cautious, precise and single-mindedly aimed at one goal: winning. Knowing that she had to persuade male, establishment-oriented judges, she often picked male plaintiffs, and she liked Social Security cases because they illustrated how discrimination against women can harm men. For example, in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, she represented a man whose wife, the principal breadwinner, died in childbirth. The husband sought survivor's benefits to care for his child, but under the then-existing Social Security law, only widows, not widowers, were entitled to such benefits. \"This absolute exclusion, based on gender per se, operates to the disadvantage of female workers, their surviving spouses, and their children,\" Ginsburg told the justices at oral argument. The Supreme Court would ultimately agree, as it did in five of the six cases she argued. Over the years, Ginsburg would file dozens of briefs seeking to persuade the courts that the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection applies not just to racial and ethnic minorities but to women as well. In an interview with NPR, she explained the legal theory that she eventually sold to the Supreme Court. \"The words of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause — 'nor shall any state deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.' Well that word, 'any person,' covers women as well as men. And the Supreme Court woke up to that reality in 1971,\" Ginsburg said. During these pioneering years, Ginsburg would often work through the night as she had during law school. But by this time, she had two children, and she later liked to tell a story about the lesson she learned when her son, in grade school, seemed to have a proclivity for getting into trouble. The scrapes were hardly major, and Ginsburg grew exasperated by demands from school administrators that she come in to discuss her son's alleged misbehavior. Finally, there came a day when she had had enough. \"I had stayed up all night the night before, and I said to the principal, 'This child has two parents. Please alternate calls.' \"\nAfter that, she found, the calls were few and far between. It seemed, she said, that most infractions were not worth calling a busy husband about.

{"query": "JOHN SCOTT BROOKS robbed a bankOKLAHOMA CITY – This afternoon, a federal jury in Oklahoma City found JOHN SCOTT BROOKS, 55, of Lawton, guilty of bank robbery involving a fake bomb, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester. According to evidence at trial, on March 23, 2020, Brooks pulled up to the drive-through teller lane at the Southwest Oklahoma Federal Credit Union located at 6714 West Gore Boulevard, Lawton, Oklahoma, and placed a fake bomb in the teller drawer.  He immediately showed the teller a timer, which was counting down. Brooks then attempted to get away with the robbery by altering the appearance of his vehicle, creating a cover story, and erasing electronic information from his cell phone. Evidence at trial included bank surveillance footage of the robbery, a bank robbery list found at Brooks’ residence, and a vehicle image comparison analysis performed by an FBI forensic examiner.  Multiple witnesses testified that they recognized Brooks in the still photo of the surveillance footage taken from the robbery.   The trial lasted two days and the jury deliberated approximately two hours before finding Brooks guilty of one count of bank robbery.  He was acquitted on a count of making a bomb threat.   At sentencing, Brooks faces up to twenty-five years in prison, three years of supervised release, a fine of $250,000, and mandatory restitution.  Sentencing will take place in approximately 90 days.

Hamilton Township initially announced that there were four cases of Legionnaires' a year ago, NJ Advance Media reported. “There is concern that Legionella may be present in other buildings and homes in the area,” Hamilton and state officials said in a statement.  No other towns served by Trenton Water Works, a public utility, have reported Legionnaires' cases, which can be treated with antibiotics. “The water is safe to drink, but there are basic precautions that residents can take to help protect themselves – such as regularly flushing water at their taps and maintaining their hot water tank,” Dr. Tina Tan, state epidemiologist, said in a statement released by Hamilton Township.  Legionnaires' disease doesn't spread from person-to-person. The bacteria spreads through airborne mist, such as from industrial air-conditioning units for large buildings.

{"query": "Covid-19 overtakes 1918 Spanish flu as deadliest disease in American historyThe Covid-19 pandemic has become the deadliest disease event in American history, with a death toll surpassing that of the 1918 Spanish flu. The Spanish flu was previously the disease event that caused the biggest loss of life in the United States; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 pandemic, in waves of illness that stretched out over roughly two years in this country. According to STAT’s Covid-19 Tracker, Covid deaths stand at more than 675,400.  “In terms of raw numbers of deaths, that’s a high number,” said Howard Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. “And it’s higher still than it should have been, frankly.” U.S. deaths make up roughly 14% of the nearly 4.7 million fatalities that have been reported worldwide in this pandemic to date, even though the country’s population comprises only about 4.2% of the global population. advertisement “In the U.S., we are among the worst affected in our class of countries — rich countries with an aging population. But other countries in Europe did poorly as well,” said Cécile Viboud, an infectious diseases epidemiologist who has done a lot of research into deaths from the 1918 flu. A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day. Whether the Covid pandemic will qualify as the deadliest event in U.S. history is perhaps a question for Civil War historians. The long-accepted toll of the War Between the States was 620,000, which this pandemic has already surpassed. But in 2011, David Hacker, a historian at Binghamton University in New York State, published an article in the journal Civil War History arguing the true number of deaths in the Civil War was more likely around 750,000. The heavy toll the pandemic has taken in the U.S. is due to the country’s inadequate response early on, said Markel. David Morens, a medical historian at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed. “I think it’s generally known around the world that America didn’t do a very good job in the early stages of controlling the pandemic,” said Morens, who has also written extensively on the 1918 flu pandemic. Comparing events that happened more than a century apart has its perils. For instance, the population of the United States in 1918 was a third of what it is now. So as a percentage of the national population, the Spanish flu deaths still has the lead on Covid-19. Likewise, the mean age of the people who died in 1918 was 28, whereas with Covid, deaths are occurring mainly in the elderly, said Viboud, who works at the National Institutes of Health’s Fogerty International Center. In terms of cumulative years of life lost, the Spanish flu’s impact thus remains greater. But modern medicine is far more advanced than what was available in 1918. Now people whose lungs are under attack from Covid can be put on ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — ECMO — machines, which pump oxygen into blood when a person’s heart and lungs are no longer up to the job. These were not options in 1918. And for months now, the country has had vaccines that are highly effective at lowering the risk of dying from Covid. Still the fatalities pile up, though at a slower rate than earlier in the pandemic. “We have no idea what would have been the impact of Covid-19 without interventions,” Viboud acknowledged. The deaths will continue to climb for some time still, Morens noted. “Remember, we’re still counting,” he said. “In 1918, the pandemic became not so deadly within two years. We have no idea — I don’t and I don’t trust anybody who says they do — where this Covid-19 will go.” The global Covid death figure is without doubt an underestimate, but then again, the American tally likely is as well. “The true deaths from Covid-19 in the United States are probably higher than the actual numbers. But how much higher is a matter of speculation,” Morens said. There is some work that suggests what a truer figure might be, Viboud said, pointing to a research paper published in the journal eLife in June. The study, by Ariel Karlinsky, an economist and statistician at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and Dmitry Kobak, of the Institute for Ophthalmic Research at the University of Tübingen in Germany, actually attempted to estimate a more accurate picture of Covid deaths in 103 countries. Their calculations were based on looking at what is known as excess mortality, the differences between the number of deaths reported since the start of the pandemic and the annual average mortality figures for the years 2015 through 2019 in each of the countries studied. Some countries have actually had fewer deaths — negative excess mortality — during the pandemic. One such country is New Zealand, which has managed in the main to keep Covid from spreading by using stringent border controls. New Zealand reported 1,900 fewer deaths than normal during the pandemic, the Karlinsky and Kobak paper reported, attributing the lower number of deaths to the fact that viruses like influenza haven’t circulated to normal degrees during the pandemic. Their work estimated that the true Covid death toll in the United States is probably 10% higher than the declared number of lives lost to the disease in the country. That would place the Covid deaths in America in the ballpark of 741,000. In rivaling the Spanish flu, the Covid-19 pandemic has given medical historians a new lesson to teach, said Markel, who wrote about that fact last month in The Atlantic. “The truth is we have no historical precedent for the moment we’re in now,” he wrote. “We need to stop thinking back to 1918 as a guide for how to act in the present and to start thinking forward from 2021 as a guide to how to act in the future.” In his interview with STAT, Markel recalled that during a briefing he gave to former President Barack Obama about the 1918 pandemic — he was president during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic — Obama noted that 1918 was a long time ago. That’s the problem with disease outbreaks that are 100-year events; they are so rare that the lessons one can take from them may seem out of date when they are next needed. “We finally now have a modern pandemic,” said Markel. “In modern times with modern vaccines and so on. So to me, this is the one I’m going to be teaching my medical students and public health students.” ", "label": [{"name": "疾病爆发", "arguments": {"日期": "2009", "疾病名称": "H1N1", "受影响地区": "New Zealand", "疫情数据发布机构": "the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "死亡病例": "741,000", "预防措施": "using stringent border controls"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

{"query": "WHO to create COVID-19 vaccine hub in South AfricaSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the move to create a COVID-19 vaccine hub in his country will improve manufacturing for the entire continent. Photo by Gianluigi Guercia/EPA-EFE June 21 (UPI) -- The World Health Organization announced Monday it is establishing a hub in South Africa where manufacturers from low- and middle-income countries can gain the knowledge and licenses necessary to produce their own vaccines against the coronavirus. The WHO has for months warned against the inequitable access to vaccines worldwide with richer nations seeking to inoculate their entire populations against the virus at the expense of lives in poorer countries.  In mid-April, due to the urgent need for vaccines in poorer nations, particularly those in Africa, the WHO issued a call to see interest in establishing a transfer hub for mRNA vaccine technology, which is used in the creation of some of the coronavirus jabs, in order to manufacture their own COVID-19 vaccines. \"Today, I am delighted to announce that WHO is in discussions with a consortium of companies and institutions to establish a technology transfer hub in South Africa,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters during a press conference , explaining the WHO will lead the effort by establishing the criteria for technology transfer, assessing applications and developing standards and proving support and training. The WHO head said they had received more than 50 proposals from its April request from those wanting to participate in these training hubs -- half from companies and institutions wanting the mRNRA technology and half from those with the knowledge. Advertisement The majority of the companies involved in the endeavor are smaller firms but Soumya Swaminathan, WHO's lead scientist, said they are speaking with larger mRNA companies \"and hope very much they will come on board.\" \"We could see within nine to 12 months vaccines being produced in Africa,\" she said. RELATED 25% of young adults most likely won't get COVID-19 vaccine, CDC survey shows The announcement was made amid a push to vaccinate those in the African continent where the virus continues to surge. Tedros said while richer countries that are able to inoculate their citizens against the virus are seeing their daily cases and deaths decrease, the number in Africa has increased by nearly 40% in the past week with some countries experiencing their number of deaths triple or quadruple. According to Oxford University's Our World in Data project, while nearly 22% of the world has received at least one shot of a vaccine, only 0.9% of those in low-income nations have received the life-saving jab. RELATED China reaches milestone 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses On the African continent, the number is 2.4%, it said. In April, days before it issued its call for interest in the hub, the WHO said of the nearly 700 million vaccine doses administered less than 2% were in Africa where countries had only received their first shipments five weeks earlier. Advertisement The WHO said its COVAX distribution project aims to provide the 43 African nations with up to 600 million doses by the end of the year in order to inoculate at least 20% of its more than 1.3 billion people. It is unclear if these transfer hubs will alter those figures. However, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa described the transfer as a \"landmark initiative\" in advancing efforts to build vaccine development and manufacturing on the continent in order for it to create \"a path to self determination.\" \"South Africa welcomes the opportunity to host a vaccine technology transfer hub and to build on the capacity and expertise that already exists on the continent to contribute to this effort,\" he said.

During the press conference Monday, he said they are continuing with this effort. \"We from Africa have been calling for the capability, the capacity that needs to be transferred to Africa, so that we can also make our own vaccines.

{"query": "2006 Indian anti-reservation protests\n\nThe 2006 Indian anti-reservation protests were a series of protests that took place in India in 2006 in opposition to the decision of the Union Government of India, led by the Indian National Congress-headed multiparty coalition United Progressive Alliance, to implement reservations for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in central and private institutes of higher education. These protests were one of the two major protests against the Indian reservation system, the other one being the 1990 anti-Mandal protests. The government proposed to reserve 27% of seats in the premier educational institutions of India like All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and other central institutions of higher education for the OBCs in order to help them gain higher levels of representation in these institutions. This move led to massive protests, particularly from students and doctors belonging to the forward castes, who claimed that the government's proposal was discriminatory, discarded meritocracy and was driven by vote-bank politics. [1][2]\n\nIndia is divided into many endogamous groups i.e. castes and sub-castes, as a result of centuries of following Varnashrama Dharma, a social system which translates to \"types\" or \"order\". In olden times, the castes which were considered high in the Hindu caste hierarchy i.e. Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, Shudras. [3]\n\nDuring the British Raj, some methods for upliftment of these lower castes were introduced by the British, progressive thinkers and Hindu reformers. These included reservations in the legislature and in government jobs. [4] After independence, the Indian constitution introduced provisions for reservations for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SC/ST) in government institutions, to give a fair representation to the weakest sections of society i.e. Dalits and Adivasis. 22.5% of the seats (SC- 15%, ST- 7.5%) in higher education institutes and public sector undertakings at both state and central level were set-aside for them. Uplifting the SC/ST's representation par with the upper castes has not yet been achieved. In 1989, the then-Prime Minister of India V. P. Singh accepted and implemented nationwide the proposals of the Mandal Commission, which had been established by the Morarji Desai-led Janata Party government in 1979. The proposals of this commission recommended 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in public sector undertakings and state-level educational institutions. OBC's were a group of castes which fell in-between the upper castes and Dalits; they were historically not oppressed and socially boycotted as the Dalits and Adivasis, but were still socially, educationally and economically backward compared to the upper castes. Though some Indian states such as Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh had already implemented the OBC reservations earlier in their higher educational institutions, this decision now forced every Indian state to implement OBC reservation. By combining this 27% quota for OBC's and the earlier 22.5% reservation for the SC/ST's, the percentage of general (unreserved) seats in any medical, engineering or other institute falling under the state government reduced to 50.5%. This included even the unaided private colleges. As a result, there was widespread protests from the students belonging to the unreserved category (forward castes), claiming that they were being discriminated and that merit was being discarded. On 5 April 2006, Congress leader and then-Human Resource Development Minister Arjun Singh, promised to implement a 27% reservation for OBCs in institutes of higher education (twenty central universities, the IITs, NITs, IIMs and AIIMS) after the State Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry, Assam and West Bengal, in accordance with the 93rd Constitutional Amendment which was passed unanimously by both Houses of Parliament. [5] The 93rd Constitutional Amendment allows the government to make special provisions for the \"advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\", including their admission in aided or unaided private educational institutions. Gradually this reservation policy is to be implemented in private sector institutions and companies as well. [6] Private sector institutions and companies had never come under the purview of reservation. The text of the 93rd amendment reads-\n\nGreater access to higher education including professional education, is of great importance to a large number of students belonging to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and other socially and educationally backward classes of citizens. The reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes of citizens in admission to educational institution is derived from the provisions of clause(4) of article 15 of the constitution. At present, the number of seats available in aided or State maintained institutions, particularly in respect of professional education, is limited, in comparison to those in private aided institutions. Clause(i) of article 30 of the Constitution provides the right to all minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. It is essential that the rights available to minorities are protected in regard to institutions established and administered by them. Accordingly, institutions declared by the State to be minority institutions under clause(1) of article 30 are excluded from the operation of this enactment. To promote the educational advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens,i.e., the Other Backward Classes or of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in matters of admission of students belonging to these categories in unaided educational institutions, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause(1) of article 30, the provisions of article 15 were amplified. The new clause(5) of said article 15 shall enable the Parliament as well as the State legislatures to make appropriate laws for the above mentioned purpose. [7]\nThis move led to opposition from students, as the proposal would reduce seats for the general category from the existing 77.5% to less than 51% (since members of OBCs are also allowed to contest in the General category), despite assurance from the government that the number of seats in these educational institutes will be increased so that effectively there will be no reduction in the number of seats available for the general category. The opposing students also felt that the government's move was merely to placate and consolidate the OBC vote bank. The private sector organisations too opposed the move, saying it would impede merit and reduce the competitiveness of the students. [8]\n\nThe protests began from 26 April 2006 with medical students protesting in New Delhi against the government's proposal, where students were lathi-charged and water cannons and tear gas were fired on the students. [9][10] Another such protest was carried out by medical students in New Delhi on 13 May 2006 where students were again lathi-charged and detained for few hours. [11] Medical students held a protest in Mumbai on 14 May 2006, where students were lathi-charged, despite the protest being banned by the Bombay High Court. [12] They were lathi-charged by the police. [12] In retaliation of the police action toward the anti-reservation protestors, a nationwide strike was launched by the \"anti-reservation\" medical students. Doctors from all over India who opposed the government's proposal too joined the protest. The government took measures to counter the protesting doctors by serving them with suspension letters and asking them to vacate the hostels to make way for newly recruited doctors. Some states invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) and gave notices to the doctors to return to work, failing which legal action would be taken against them. The government also put on alert 6,000 men from the Rapid Action Force to take care of any untoward incident. However, in most places the protesters remained defiant despite ESMA. Most forward caste students across India took to the streets, boycotting classes. In Delhi, a human chain rally was organized on 20 May by the students of IIT Delhi with the support of PanIIT, the IIT alumni organisation, to protest the OBC reservation. Nearly 150 students of New Delhi's 5 Medical Colleges went on a 'relay' hunger strike in AIIMS which lasted for about a month. A resolution signed by 2,500 IIT Roorkee students expressing their opposition to the OBC reservation, was sent to the then-President Abdul Kalam, the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the then-Chief Justice of India Y. K. Sabharwal and the Election Commission of India.", "label": [{"name": "抗议", "arguments": {"日期": "20 May", "抗议原因": "the decision of the Union Government of India, led by the Indian National Congress-headed multiparty coalition United Progressive Alliance, to implement reservations for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in central and private institutes of higher education", "地点": "Mumbai", "抗议者": "medical students"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

{"query": "Brown locust plague threatens Eastern Cape farmersLocust in the Eastern Cape are moving westward rapidly, warns Agri Eastern Cape A brown locust outbreak that aggregated in the drought-ravaged Sarah Baartman and Chris Hani districts in the Eastern Cape is now moving westwards, warns Eben Du Plessis, chairman of the communications committee at Agri Eastern Cape. Du Plessis cautions that this brown locust outbreak has the potential to be a colossal natural disaster that could eat deep into the famers’ pockets if it is not addressed. The Eastern Cape provincial department of national development and agrarian reform in a recent media statement described the brown locust as an agricultural pest in South Africa that attacks all types of crops, although it prefers grasses, cereal crops and maize fields. READ: ARC wants Southern Africa fruit fly free in 3 years Prof. Frances Duncan, environmentalist at the school of animal, plant and environmental sciences at the University of Witwatersrand says that brown locusts (Locustana pardalina) exist all year round, but their numbers grow especially during the dry season. Duncan says the locusts continue to breed when it is dry, laying eggs. “The brown locust is fascinating because the eggs can stay dormant for three to five years. When there is a build-up of the eggs in the soil and the good rains come then all of these eggs start hatching. The hoppers emerge and they meet each other and start to form hopper bands.” Duncan says a female locust can lay about three to four egg packets in her lifetime, which lasts a month. Each egg packet can consist of about 20 eggs. She explains that the brown locust then goes through five growth stages before it can become a fully grown adult that is ready to fly. She explains that the brown locusts are particularly harmful to crops because if a swarm ends up on the maize fields, they consume the entire field. “At the moment the impact is not so severe, except that the locusts are competing with the livestock to consume grass. So, you don’t notice it that much but the impact could become very severe when the flying locust take off and they get into, for example, the Free State maize fields. That can cause considerable damage. They also eat the growing crops and that’s when food security is threatened,” she says. Brown locusts moving west rapidly Du Plessis warns that the damage that could be done by the brown locust in the Eastern Cape is enormous. “The brown locusts in the Eastern Cape are moving westward at a very rapid pace. They are still walking at this stage and not flying, which makes it a lot easier for spraying. But as soon as they start flying, they are going to move very fast and will do a lot of damage,” he says. He estimates that a swarm of locusts can damage a hectare of food per day and he believes that the brown locust is not a threat to food security, but rather a threat to farmers’ expenditure. “I don’t think it will have a direct impact on food security, but it will definitely impact farmers because it impacts their grazing. They have to move animals and give additional feed to the animals since the brown locusts have the potential of destroying a lot of hectares in the Karoo,” he explains. He indicates that they are trying to curb the brown locust outbreak by all means necessary with the assistance of the Eastern Cape provincial department of national development and agrarian reform and the national department of agriculture, land reform and rural development. “We are getting good support from the national department. These types of outbreaks fall under national departments. In De Aar we have made some recommendations from Agri Eastern Cape side to the national department and they are listening to us and helping a lot at this stage,” he says. He says the known affected areas are to the east of Middleburg, Graaff-Reinet and Cradock “They are a lot easier to contain when they are not flying because they don’t move so fast. The sprayers can identify and spray them with pesticides before they can disappear.” Du Plessis says the brown locusts first hit drought-stricken towns in the Northern Cape before moving to the Eastern Cape. “Some of them are hatching in the Eastern Cape, but a lot of them are hatching in the dry areas of the Northern Cape and then moving into the Eastern Cape. Areas like Richmond, Hanover and Noupoort have been spraying for the last month already,” he says. East African plague still a threat Hundreds of billions of locusts of a different species swarmed through parts of East Africa and South Asia in the worst infestation for a quarter of a century, threatening crops and livelihoods earlier this year. The swarms first appeared in Kenya in late December 2019, with a second wave following in April. The region is now bracing for a third, possibly bigger wave in the weeks ahead. Locusts haven’t been seen at this scale, in these numbers, for 70 years. According to the United Nations, a locust swarm one square kilometre in size can eat the same amount of food in a day as 35,000 people, a devastating amount of destruction for local farmers. Several countries and NGOs such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated over R2.8 billion to contain the swarms, making some progress in East Africa and Yemen, as well the Gulf states, Iran, Pakistan and India. Food For Mzansi is an initiative to introduce South Africans to the unsung heroes of the agricultural industry.

{"query": "1979 Sydney Ghost Train fire\n\nThe Sydney Ghost Train fire at Luna Park Sydney killed six children and one adult on 9 June 1979. It destroyed the amusement park's ghost train. Inadequate fire-fighting measures and low staffing caused the fire to completely destroy the ride. It is believed the Ghost Train ride was first constructed in 1931 and transported from Glenelg, South Australia to Milsons Point, New South Wales during 1934 and 1935. [1]\n\nOriginally the fire was blamed on electrical faults, but arson by known figures has also been claimed. The exact cause of the fire could not be determined by a coronial inquiry. The coroner also ruled that, while the actions of Luna Park's management and staff before and during the fire (in particular their choosing not to follow advice on the installation of a sprinkler system in the ride) breached their duty of care, charges of criminal negligence should not be laid. The case was reopened in 1987: no new findings were made, although the police investigation and coronial inquiry were criticised. The fire forced the closure of Luna Park until 1982, when it reopened under a new name and new owners. [2]\n\nA memorial garden was installed by Luna Park in 1995, but its fixtures were lost during the park's 2003 redevelopment. In replacement, a plaque listing those killed was placed on the location of the ride, but a promised mural to surround the plaque was never painted. A separate memorial park was created by North Sydney Council in 2007, including a sculpture by Michael Leunig. Luna Park's Ghost Train was a ghost train-style amusement ride. Designed and constructed in 1931 at Luna Park Glenelg, the ride was transported to Milsons Point along with all the other rides and reassembled prior to Luna Park Sydney's first opening in October 1935. Architectural plans and drawings of rides and buildings at Luna Park Sydney (Milson’s Point, New South Wales) are held at the State Library of New South Wales, including the Ghost Train ride. The plans and drawings include some from Luna Park Melbourne (St Kilda, Victoria) and Luna Park Glenelg (Glenelg, South Australia). [3]\n\nOn the night of 9 June 1979, a fire broke out inside the ride at approximately 10:15 pm. Due to a combination of low water pressure, under-staffing within the park, and inadequate coverage of the Ghost Train by the park's fire hose system, the fire was able to completely consume the ride. [4][5] It took an hour to bring the fire under control, but it was extinguished before any significant damage could be done to the adjacent River Caves and Big Dipper. [5][6]\n\nAround 35 people were believed to have been on the ride when thick smoke began to escape from the tunnel doors. [6] Ride staff raised the alarm, and began to pull people from the ride as their cars exited the tunnel. [6] It was initially thought that everybody had escaped the fire, but at around 11:30 pm, the bodies of seven people were found inside the ride: John Godson and his two children, Damien and Craig, and four Waverley College students; Jonathan Billings, Richard Carroll, Michael Johnson, and Seamus Rahilly. [5][6] At the time of the fire, investigating police speculated that the seven had climbed out of their cars and unsuccessfully tried to find their way out of the tunnel; had they stayed in the cars, they might have survived. [6] Other evacuated passengers reported seeing empty cars exit the tunnel on fire. [7]\n\nThe park was shut down immediately after the incident for a federal investigation. [4][6] A coronial inquiry into the incident did not determine the cause of the fire, although it was demonstrated that the ride's permanent wiring and attractions were not the source of ignition. [4] Coroner Kevin Anderson found that Luna Park's management had failed to develop an adequate fire suppression program, despite recommendations by North Sydney Council and the Fire Department eighteen months earlier. [4] Anderson's report stated that while the park's owners and management had failed in their duty of care towards patrons, the failure was not \"that high degree of negligence necessary to support a charge of criminal negligence\". [8] The NSW Government called for new tenders to operate the park on 31 July 1979. [9]\n\nBefore the fire, a Sydney design consultant stated that he had advised Luna Park management to install a sprinkler system in the Ghost Train in December 1977, following an inspection of the park for potential renovations. [6] The recommendation was not followed. [4][6]\n\nIn 1987, a Government inquiry by the National Crime Authority reopened the investigation of the fire. [10] No new evidence was presented, but it was found that the police investigation into the incident had been inadequate, and the coronial inquiry ineffective. [10]\n\nDespite claims ranging from faulty wiring to sabotage in an attempt to have the park closed down and demolished, the cause of the fire has never been established. [10]\n\nIn May 2007, Anne Buckingham, a niece of Sydney underworld figure Abe Saffron, claimed in an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald that her uncle was responsible for the fire. [11] Saffron had been associated with seven other arson attacks in the two years following the Ghost Train fire, although he had repeatedly denied involvement with the Ghost Train fire. [5][11] Buckingham claimed the attack was part of a plan for Saffron to gain control of Luna Park's lease, although she stated her belief that the seven deaths were not intended. [11]\n\nFormer Park Artist Martin Sharp claimed that Saffron had approached Luna Park's owner, Ted Hopkins, several years before the fire, offering to buy the park. [5] In 1985, it was claimed by NSW MP Michael John Hatton that Saffron had beneficial ownership of the park, resulting in an inquiry which concluded that although people related to Saffron were involved in supplying pinball and arcade games to Luna Park, Abe Saffron himself was not linked to the ownership of the park. [5]\n\nBuckingham later denied she made the comments attributed to her and demanded the story not be published, although the Herald claims her original statements were recorded on tape during a face-to-face interview. [11] The NSW Attorney General has stated the coronial inquiry could be reopened, but would first require the submission of new evidence to the police. [12]\n\nA memorial was dedicated in 1995 to the seven victims of the 1979 fire, with a tree planted next to an antique bench decorated with the names of the victims. [13] During the 2003 redevelopment, the tree was removed and the bench lost. [13] Park director Warwick Doughty claimed that the memorial and events had little relevance, although North Sydney mayor Genia McCaffery, among others, disagreed and campaigned for the memorial's reinstatement. [13] In 2004, a plaque listing the names of the victims was placed on an external wall of the Big Top, which was constructed on the site of the Ghost Train. [14][15] The plaque was to be the centrepiece of a mural painted by former Park Artist Martin Sharp,[15] but this has never been painted. At least one person present at the unveiling of the plaque was unimpressed with the new memorial. [15]\n\nA memorial park was opened at Lavender Bay by North Sydney Council on 25 August 2007. [16] The Art Barton Park, named after former Park Artist Arthur Barton, includes a bronze sculpture designed by Michael Leunig dedicated to the victims.

{"query": "Northwest Airlines Flight 85 crashNorthwest Airlines Flight 85 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in the United States to Narita International Airport in Japan. On October 9, 2002, while over the Bering Sea, the Boeing 747-400 experienced a lower rudder hardover event, which occurs when an aircraft's rudder deflects to its travel limit without crew input. The 747's hardover gave full left lower rudder, requiring the pilots to use full right upper rudder and right aileron to maintain attitude and course. The flight diverted to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. No passengers or crew were injured, but the incident resulted in an airworthiness directive to prevent the possibility of a future accident. The aircraft involved was the prototype Boeing 747-400 (Boeing 747-451, c/n 23719, reg N661US) and was built by Boeing for flight testing as N401PW, before subsequently being reregistered as N661US and delivered to Northwest Airlines (the launch customer for the 747-400) on December 8, 1989. [2] The aircraft was later delivered to Delta Air Lines on October 29, 2008. After a further seven years in service with Delta, N661US was retired in 2015, and was then sent to the Delta Flight Museum for preservation on April 30, 2016. [3]\n\nThe flight departed Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. The incident occurred at 5:40 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time, around seven hours into the flight. [4] At the time of the incident, Junior Captain Frank Geib and First Officer Mike Fagan had just taken control of the aircraft, allowing Senior Captain John Hanson and First Officer David Smith to rest. [5] Flight 85's captain said that the event occurred at flight level 350 (35,000 feet/11,000 meters). [1]\n\nThe aircraft abruptly entered a 30- to 40-degree left bank. [1] Geib initially believed that an engine failure had occurred. Hanson reentered the cockpit and continued to fly the aircraft by hand with Fagan. Geib declared an emergency and began a diversion to Anchorage. [5] While the crew tried to declare the emergency, the plane was in a communications dead zone between North America and Asia. Even with a weak signal, the crew contacted another Northwest Airlines flight, Flight 19, which helped Flight 85 declare the emergency as it was closer to Alaska. [6] Flight 85's captain reported that none of the emergency procedures available could correct the problem. [1] The pilots established a conference call with Northwest Airlines at the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, but the employees there were unable to find a solution to the sudden bank. [5] The flight crew took back control of the aircraft and landed at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. To steer the aircraft, they had to use the ailerons and asymmetric engine thrust, applying more engine power to one side than the other. [4]\n\nHanson said that crew resource management (CRM) contributed to the flight's safe landing at Anchorage: \"This was a classic application of CRM. We were blessed and lucky that we had full flight crew augmentation. We had four pilots to work together in the cockpit. We had an excellent group of flight attendants on board; that became important later because we briefed this as a ‘red’ emergency, which means there’s at least a solid chance you’re going to have to evacuate. We weren’t sure we were going to be able to keep the airplane on the runway. \"[5] The incident did not initially receive media attention. [4]\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Boeing launched investigations into the incident. [4] NTSB investigator Carolyn Deforge, who oversaw the investigation, recounted on the television program Mayday (Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency): \"it appeared to be a very dramatic event, and ...  it definitively seemed like something we needed to follow up on, trying to understand what had happened. \"[6]\n\nThe NTSB found that there was a fatigue crack in the power control module and that it was not possible to visually inspect that type of failure. [1] The lower rudder control module's cast metal housing had broken. The end portion of the control module housing that housed the yaw damper actuator had separated from the main portion of the housing. [4] Deforge said in the Mayday episode that the NW85 failure was unusual because most failures are of internal components rather than of the housing itself. [6]\n\nThe NTSB ruled that the probable cause was a \"fatigue fracture of the lower rudder power control module manifold, which resulted in a lower rudder hardover. \"[1] In a rudder hardover, the rudder is driven to its full deflection and stays there. [7]\n\nA non-destructive inspection process for the module was developed. As a result, Boeing issued Alert Service Bulletin 747-27A2397. The bulletin, dated July 24, 2003, recommended that Boeing 747 operators conduct ultrasonic inspections of pertinent high-time lower and upper rudder power control modules. [1]:4\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration published a Notice of Proposed Rule Making for an airworthiness directive that would make ultrasonic inspections mandatory on Boeing 747-400, 400D and 400F aircraft. The \"Airworthiness Directive; Boeing Model 747-400, -400D, and -400F Series Airplanes\" was published in the federal register on August 28, 2003. [1]:4 The directive, labeled Directive 2003-23-01,[9] was issued on November 3, 2003 and became effective December 18, 2003. [10] It has since been superseded by directive 2006-18-17,[11] issued August 30, 2006 and effective October 13, 2006. [12] In 2008, a proposed replacement to this directive was published. [13][14]\n\nN661US was not damaged during the incident and it was returned to service with Northwest Airlines. [15]\n\nBy January 2004, the Air Line Pilots Association awarded the \"Superior Airmanship Award\" to the crew of Northwest 85. [5]\n\nOn February 24, 2009, the aircraft involved in the incident, along with the other 747-400s in Northwest Airlines' fleet, joined the Delta Air Lines fleet as part of the Northwest-Delta Air Lines merger. On September 8, 2015, it left Honolulu, Hawaii for its final flight and was retired on arrival at Atlanta, Georgia's Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It was transferred to the adjacent Delta Flight Museum for public display at the end of April 2016.

(CNN) ALGIERS, Algeria (CNN) -- Rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the United Nations headquarters in Algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building's facade and leveled nearby U.N. offices. Rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building.\n It was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other.\n The death toll is unclear: the official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that 76 people were killed in the two blasts. A statement from the United Nations said 45 people were reported killed.\n Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court.\n In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility.\n CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups.\n In the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Othman and Abdel Rahman Abu Abdel Nasser al-Asimi. It said two trucks were filled with \"no less than 800 kg (1,763 pounds) of explosives.\"\n The group called the operation \"another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the wounded Islamic nation and in defiance to the Crusaders and their agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France.\"\n At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe.\n The offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the U.N. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday.\n   \"Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works,\" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said from its Geneva headquarters. Watch his full interview  He said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.N. workers. \"It's a very serious situation still with the U.N. in Algiers,\" he said.\n In a strongly worded statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called \"an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals under the U.N. banner.\"\n \"The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by Algerian authorities and the international community,\" Ban said in the written statement.\n He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort.\n Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the Constitutional Council -- which oversees elections -- and Supreme Court in the Algiers neighborhood of Ben Aknoun, according to the state-run Algeria Press Agency.\n That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported.\n One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. \"I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to run away from the car,\" he said.\n Zerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people.\n That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year. It abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al Qaeda.\n CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton said the merger combined the expertise of Algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al Qaeda in North Africa, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers.\n She said the group's goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which it sees as enemies of the Islamic state.\n Zerhouni said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets.\n Algeria, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win.\n Tens of thousands of people died in the unrest.

{"query": "November_2017 Garrison Keillor, the former host of A Prairie Home Companion, is fired from Minnesota Public Radio after the public broadcaster discloses that it had become aware of allegations of \"inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him\". (The Washington Post)Garrison Keillor, one of the nation’s most lauded humorists, was fired Wednesday by Minnesota Public Radio over allegations of “inappropriate behavior” that occurred while he was in charge of “A Prairie Home Companion,” his long-running variety show heard nationwide by millions every week.\nKeillor, 75, who retired from the show last year and did not respond to a request for comment, denied any wrongdoing but described what he believed to be the allegation against him in an email to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.\n“I put my hand on a woman’s bare back,” he wrote. “I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later and she replied that she had forgiven me and not to think about it. We were friends. We continued to be friendly right up until her lawyer called.”\nMinnesota Public Radio did not immediately confirm whether this allegation was the reason for his firing and declined to give additional details on the accusation in question, including whether it was sexual in nature. The news broke hours after another enduring broadcaster, \"Today\" show host Matt Lauer, was fired by NBC for \"inappropriate sexual behavior.\"\n“Minnesota Public Radio is terminating its contracts with Garrison Keillor and his private media companies after recently learning of allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him,” said Angie Andresen, communications director for the station.\nKeillor spent his career creating and tending to a fictional place called Lake Wobegon, “the little town that time forgot and the decades cannot improve.” His radio show, “A Prairie Home Companion,” launched in 1974, stitched together old-timey jingles for fictional brands of biscuits and acoustic performances by guest musicians. But the heart of the show was Keillor’s storytelling — a slow, artfully rambling monologue about a stoic heartland community.\nBy the 1980s, Keillor had won a Peabody, and the show was one of public radio’s biggest cash cows — as popular as public-radio juggernauts “Car Talk” and “Marketplace,” and capable of matching the audience of the Saturday TV baseball Game of the Week.\n[‘Today’ show host Matt Lauer fired after claims of ‘inappropriate sexual behavior’]\nKeillor was shy, wry and unreadable in many ways, but his grave persona created an American enterprise as familiar and cozy as a hearth.\nHis program, despite its sense of place, was a road show, with a tractor-trailer full of sets and props and a traveling crew of stagehands, producers and performers who spent long hours together in college auditoriums, civic centers and hotel rooms.\nKeillor has been married three times. One of his long-term girlfriends worked with him on the show. But three longtime members of the show’s staff, who asked not to be named because they don’t know the details of the new accusation, said that Keillor’s shrinking demeanor and social awkwardness were a far more powerful part of his personality than any forwardness around women.\n“The guy screams ‘fatherly,’ ” one longtime female staffer said. “He was awkward and fascinating and lovely.”\nOn the road, Keillor kept mainly to himself, holed up in his hotel room to write his weekly monologue. Writers would join him to work over material, but those encounters were often stilted and quiet, the co-workers said.\nIn 1994, Keillor addressed the National Press Club and defended Bill Clinton against a battery of accusations, calling him a “soulful man” who “got himself elected without scaring people.” Keillor warned that society should try “not to make the world so fine and good that you and I can’t enjoy living in it.”\nHe added in his hangdog baritone: “A world in which there is no sexual harassment at all, is a world in which there will not be any flirtation. A world without thieves at all will not have entrepreneurs.” Twenty-three years later — amid a reckoning of workplace behavior that has felled politicians, TV anchors and Hollywood heavies — a viewer is left to wonder: Was Keillor being straight, or satirical?\nIn 1998 Keillor wrote “Wobegon Boy,” a novel about a radio host who is wrongly accused of sexual harassment and fired by his station.\nOn Tuesday, the day before his firing, The Washington Post published his opinion piece ridiculing the idea that Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) should resign over allegations of sexual harassment.\nCalls for Franken’s head are “pure absurdity,” Keillor wrote, “and the atrocity it leads to is a code of public deadliness.”\nKeillor, an avowed Democrat, last year became a weekly columnist for The Washington Post News Service and Syndicate — meaning he was a contract writer, not an employee with a desk in the newsroom. Many of his columns took mournful aim at President Trump, who “would have enjoyed the 17th century,” when “the idea of privileged sexual aggression was common in high places.”\n[Violence. Threats. Begging. Harvey Weinstein’s 30-year pattern of abuse in Hollywood.]\nRichard Aldacushion, general manager and editorial director of The Washington Post News Service and Syndicate, said there was no revision of its relationship with Keillor as of late Wednesday. The organization “takes the allegations against columnist Garrison Keillor seriously and is seeking more information about them,” the syndicate told its clients Wednesday.\nIn his email to the Star-Tribune, Keillor shared other thoughts. “If I had a dollar for every woman who asked to take a selfie with me and who slipped an arm around me and let it drift down below the beltline, I’d have at least a hundred dollars,” he wrote. “So this is poetic irony of a high order. But I’m just fine. I had a good long run and am grateful for it and for everything else.”\nMinnesota Public Radio said it has retained an outside law firm to conduct an “independent investigation” into the allegations. The station will stop distributing and broadcasting “The Writer’s Almanac,” a show Keillor still produced after retiring from “A Prairie Home Companion.” The latter show, which will be renamed, has been hosted by Chris Thile since Keillor’s retirement.\nIn 1998, when \"Prairie Home\" was on 433 stations and in the ears of 2.5 million listeners, a Washington Post reporter spent a week with the show to write a profile of Keillor. One day, after rehearsal, the host gathered his cast in his hotel room for water and appetizers.\n“Care for a social moment?” he asked.\nThe group stood around awkwardly for a few minutes, and at one point they all tried to speak in the voices of a variety of animals — whale, walrus, horse, bird — which provided a chance to exhale and chuckle. But after a short time, Keillor brought the social moment to an end.\n“I might write something new,” he said, which was the invitation for his guests to file out of the room.", "label": [{"name": "辞职-免职", "arguments": {"批准者": "Minnesota Public Radio", "辞职者": "Garrison Keillor", "日期": "Wednesday", "辞职原因": "allegations of “inappropriate behavior” that occurred while he was in charge of “A Prairie Home Companion,” his long-running variety show heard nationwide by millions every week", "职位": "host"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

{"query": "Car pursued by police smashes into East Perth traffic light pole causing multi-vehicle crashA police pursuit has resulted in a chaotic crash scene in Perth at the intersection of East Parade and the Graham Farmer Freeway. Four cars were waiting at a red traffic light when a car being chased by police drove into the intersection, knocking a traffic light onto the stationary vehicles. The driver of the car being pursued was taken into custody and another man was transported to Royal Perth Hospital for assessment. A massive police and emergency services response was launched with about 30 police officers present, including traffic officers and several detectives. The dark-coloured hatchback had been involved in an incident in Guildford earlier in the morning and police were actively searching for the driver. It is alleged the man later drove past detectives in Guildford and when they tried to stop him, he took off before crashing into the traffic light and several cars. St John Ambulance officers and Main Roads staff also attended the scene. WA Police Inspector Mike Sparkman said it was \"very fortunate\" no one else was hurt. \"And because of the time of the day, it's caused a bit of traffic chaos,\" he said. The director of Main Roads Metropolitan Operations, Peter Sewell, also attended the crash scene. He said Main Roads staff were helping to close surrounding roads before isolating the electricity supply to the overhead traffic light. \"We expect to be here for three or four hours yet,\" he said. Mr Sewell said the traffic light would be replaced over the weekend at night to avoid being overly disruptive.

World Championships 1993 in Budapest were the joint ninth world kickboxing championships hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization arranged by Hungarian kickboxing president Richard Leyrer. As with the 1985 world championships the organization had suffered a temporary split due to political differences, and a previous event had been held in Atlantic City earlier in the month. These political differences would be resolved in the near future and the organization would be re-united. The Budapest event was open to amateur men and women from across the world - with 500 participants taking part from 47 countries. The styles on offer were Full-Contact, and for the first time ever at a W.A.K.O. championships, Low-Kick (more information on the styles can be found in the relevant sections below). Another first was that women could now take part in Full-Contact kickboxing, whereas before they could only take part in less physical styles. At the end of a very competitive championships, Poland were the top nation in terms of medals won, with Morocco a very close second and France just behind in third. The event was held in Budapest, Hungary over four days, starting on Thursday, 25 November and finishing on Sunday, 28 November. An estimated 3,500 spectators attended the championships.

{"query": "Nashville sit-ins\n\n\n\nThe Nashville sit-ins, which lasted from February 13 to May 10, 1960, were part of a nonviolent direct action campaign to end racial segregation at lunch counters in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The sit-in campaign, coordinated by the Nashville Student Movement and the Nashville Christian Leadership Council, was notable for its early success and its emphasis on disciplined nonviolence. It was part of a broader sit-in movement that spread across the southern United States in the wake of the Greensboro sit-ins in North Carolina. [1]\n\nOver the course of the Nashville sit-in campaign, sit-ins were staged at numerous stores in the central business district. Sit-in participants, who mainly consisted of black college students, were often verbally or physically attacked by white onlookers. Despite their refusal to retaliate, over 150 students were eventually arrested for refusing to vacate store lunch counters when ordered to do so by police. At trial, the students were represented by a group of 13 lawyers, headed by Z. Alexander Looby. On April 19, Looby's home was bombed, although he escaped uninjured. [1] Later that day, at least 3,000 people marched to City Hall to confront Mayor Ben West about the escalating violence. [2] When asked if he believed the lunch counters in Nashville should be desegregated, West agreed that they should. [3][1] After subsequent negotiations between the store owners and protest leaders, an agreement was reached during the first week of May. On May 10, six downtown stores began serving black customers at their lunch counters for the first time. [1]\n\nAlthough the initial campaign successfully desegregated downtown lunch counters, sit-ins, pickets, and protests against other segregated facilities continued in Nashville until passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended overt, legally sanctioned segregation nationwide. Many of the organizers of the Nashville sit-ins went on to become important leaders in the Civil Rights Movement. In 1896, the United States Supreme Court decision Plessy v. Ferguson upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the doctrine of \"separate but equal\". This decision led to the proliferation of Jim Crow laws throughout the United States. These laws mandated or explicitly allowed segregation in virtually all spheres of public life and allowed racial discrimination to flourish across the country, especially in the southern United States. [4][5]\n\nIn Nashville, like most Southern cities, African Americans were severely disadvantaged under the system of Jim Crow segregation. Besides being relegated to underfunded schools and barred from numerous public accommodations, African Americans had few prospects for skilled employment and were subject to constant discrimination from the white majority. [6][7]\n\nAlthough serious efforts were made to oppose Jim Crow laws in Nashville as early as 1905,[note 1] it was not until 1958, with the formation of the Nashville Christian Leadership Council, that Nashville's African American community would lay the foundation for dismantling racial segregation. [8]\n\n\"We decided with great fear and anticipation we would desegregate downtown Nashville. No group of black people or other people anywhere in the United States in the 20th century, against the rapaciousness of a segregated system, ever thought about desegregating downtown.\" — James Lawson, 2020[9]\n\nThe Nashville Christian Leadership Council (or NCLC), was founded by the Reverend Kelly Miller Smith, pastor of First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill. This organization was an affiliate of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and was established to promote civil rights for African Americans through nonviolent civil disobedience. Smith believed that White Americans would be more sympathetic to desegregation if African Americans obtained their rights through peaceful demonstration rather than through the judicial system or violent confrontation. [10]\n\nFrom March 26 to 28, 1958, the NCLC held the first of many workshops on using nonviolent tactics to challenge segregation. [8][11] These workshops were led by James Lawson, who had studied the principles of nonviolent resistance while working as a missionary in India. Later workshops were mainly attended by students from Fisk University, Tennessee A&I (later Tennessee State University), American Baptist Theological Seminary (later American Baptist College), and Meharry Medical College. Among those attending Lawson's sessions were students who would become significant leaders in the Civil Rights Movement, among them: Marion Barry, James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, John Lewis, Diane Nash, and C. T. Vivian. [12]\n\nDuring these workshops it was decided that the first target for the group's actions would be downtown lunch counters. At the time, African Americans were allowed to shop in downtown stores but were not allowed to eat in the stores' restaurants. The group felt that the lunch counters were a good objective because they were highly visible, easily accessible, and provided a stark example of the injustices black Southerners faced every day. [13]\n\nIn late 1959, James Lawson and other members of the NCLC's projects committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. [14][15] Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. [16][17] These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them. [18]\n\nBefore the students in Nashville had a chance to formalize their plans, events elsewhere brought renewed urgency to the effort. During the first week of February 1960, a small sit-in demonstration in Greensboro, North Carolina, grew into a significant protest with over eighty students participating by the third day. Although similar demonstrations had occurred previously in other cities, this was the first to attract substantial media attention and public notice. [19] When Lawson's group met the subsequent Friday night, about 500 new volunteers showed up to join the cause. Although Lawson and other adult organizers argued for delay, the student leaders insisted that the time had come for action. [20]\n\nThe first large-scale organized sit-in was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, most of them black, walked into the downtown Woolworths, S. H. Kress, and McLellan stores and asked to be served at the lunch counters. After the staff refused to serve them, they sat in the stores for two hours and then left without incident.", "label": [{"name": "抗议", "arguments": {"地点": "Nashville, Tennessee", "日期": "from February 13 to May 10, 1960", "抗议者": "at least 3,000", "抗议原因": "to end racial segregation"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "2014 Assiniboine River floodThe 2014 Assiniboine River flood was caused by above average precipitation in western Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Unlike most prior floods, this flood was not due to spring runoff, but rather significant rainfall. Flooding and high water involved both the main stem of the Assiniboine River and many of its tributaries including the Qu'Appelle River and the Souris River. The flood came just 3 years after the 2011 Assiniboine River Flood which was considered a 1 in 300 year event. Peak flows along the river for the first crest were generally slightly less than in 2011. However, the second peak on the river has exceeded 2011 levels starting near St. Lazare, Manitoba up to Brandon, Manitoba so far. [2][3]\n\nAfter a generally unremarkable spring in the Assiniboine River watershed with some minor flooding, a series of significant rainfall events occurred in June and early July with the most significant event occurring in Eastern Saskatchewan and Western Manitoba over the Canada Day long weekend. [4]\n\nAfter multiple states of local states of emergencies were declared in Manitoba, the Province of Manitoba declared a provincial state of emergency on July 4, and Premier Greg Selinger contacted Prime Minister Stephen Harper to request military assistance in the flood fight. [5] Troops from CFB Shilo were deployed to help sandbag vulnerable properties, shore up dikes, and monitor dikes for any breaches along the lower Assiniboine River between Portage la Prairie and Winnipeg. Dikes were reinforced and built up along the Portage Diversion as well in order for the channel to run above design capacity. Preparations were also made at the Hoop and Holler bend on Provincial Road 331 in the event a controlled breach of the lower Assiniboine River was needed to handle excess flows beyond the capacity of flood control measures. The first crest reached Brandon on July 6 with flows of 34,330 cfs below the levels of 2011 when the river crested at 36,700 cfs. [6][7] When the crest reached the Portage Reservoir on July 9, flows reached 52,100 cfs with approximately 34,100  cfs directed toward Lake Manitoba through the Portage Diversion and 18,000 cfs toward Winnipeg. [8] This was again lower than in 2011 when the river crested at the Portage Reservoir with flows of 53,100 cfs. [9]\n\nThe second crest reached St. Lazare, Manitoba on July 9 and crested at 1,290.78 feet above sea level (ASL), which was approximately 0.7 ft. higher than the previous record crest of 2011. [10] Nine homes in the St. Lazare area outside the community ring dike were damaged. [11] On July 12, the second crest reached Brandon and peak flows were measured at 38,870 cfs, which was higher than 2011 levels. [12] Record flows were experienced upstream of the confluence of the Souris and Assiniboine Rivers but not downstream of this point, as the Souris River was not experiencing significant enough flows. As a result the second crest at the Portage Reservoir was slightly lower than the first one coming in at 51,480 cfs. [13]\n\nWith excess spring flows on the Assiniboine River directed towards Lake Manitoba through use of the Portage Diversion, lake levels were above the desirable range of the lake of 810.0 to 812.0 feet above sea level (ASL) and even the upper limit of 813 feet ASL prior to the summer flood. [14][15] Continued use of the Portage Diversion occurred after it was re-opened to help mitigate against flooding, during which flows of over 34,000 cfs were directed towards the lake, well above the original designed channel capacity of the Portage Diversion of 25,000 cfs. [16][17] During the 2011 as well as the 2014 floods, work was done on the Portage Diversion to allow it to convey the higher volumes experienced. The result of this was that the water level of Lake Manitoba peaked at 814.6 feet putting residents on the lake at risk of flooding and damage from wind events. [18]\n\nPreliminary estimates of damages directly from the flooding are estimated at $1 billion for the agricultural sector alone with further damages yet to be assessed for property owners and other businesses. [19] This does not include economic losses related to economic spin-offs which are estimated to total a $3 billion loss to the economy of Manitoba. [20] Future damages may occur on Lake Manitoba as a result of the continued use of the Portage Diversion redirecting flood waters from the Assiniboine River until the lower reach of the river can handle flows without flooding. Without the use of the Portage Diversion catastrophic damages would occur downstream. However, even with the restriction of flows on the lower Assiniboine River to about 18,000 cfs property damage occurred. Numerous properties along the Assiniboine River east of Portage la Prairie suffered significant property damage as well as bank erosion and loss of mature stands of trees. Water continues to remain over the banks in the same region well into August including the KOA campground in St Francois Xavier which remained under water for approximately 4 weeks.", "label": [{"name": "洪水", "arguments": {"相关的河流或湖泊": "Assiniboine River", "受影响地区": "western Manitoba and Saskatchewan", "日期": "2014", "经济损失": "estimated at $1 billion", "原因": "above average precipitation in western Manitoba and Saskatchewan", "水位": "34,330 cfs"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

[1] As of 30 November 2020, 11 inmates were reportedly killed and about 117 inmates were severely injured during the prison riot.

(Reuters)BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Twelve people were killed late on Friday in two suicide bombings claimed by Islamic State at a shopping mall in eastern Baghdad, police and hospital sources said.\nMore than 40 people were wounded in the attack at Nakheel Mall across from the oil ministry, the sources said.

{"query": "2016 Niger flood\nHeavy rains during the months of June, July and August 2016 resulted in extreme flooding of various rivers throughout Niger, particularly the Niger River, where the floods caused material damage and loss of life in Niger and other countries along the river's path. [1][2][3][4]\n\nSince 2000, flooding in Niger has intensified,[5] with the most serious threats concentrated in the southwestern part of Niger and along the banks of the Niger River. The worst affected regions were the desert areas of Tahoua in the west and Agadez in the north, and to a lesser extent, the region of Maradi. [1][4]  Extremely fast rise of the river levels were recorded. Within a week, a rise of 1.90 m was recorded in the Sirba station in Garbé Kourou. A station on the Gorouol River, a tributary of the Niger River, measured a rise of 2.9 m over a two-week period at the end of July, the highest river level recorded in over 50 years of the station’s operation. [2][10]  Water levels continued to rise, reaching their highest mark on 6 September since 1964 in the Inner Niger Delta. [3]\n\nThe high river levels could have been exacerbated by uncommon extreme rain events throughout the Niger river basin, such as rainfall exceeding 200mm per day on May 23rd in Niger, lengthy rainy period in Guinea and Mali from August 9th to August 27th, and unusual rains in the Azawagh region, exceeding 200mm on August 13th, and around 50mm on both August 27th and 29th. [11][12][13]\n\nThe sub-Saharan region has seen an increase in the occurrence and intensity of floods during the past two decades, with the consequence of destabilizing food supply and health in an area already affected by extreme poverty and rapid population growth. [14][15][16]\n\nAccording to estimates, the 2016 flood resulted in the loss of at least 38 lives and destroyed around 9.000 homes, leaving thousands of people homeless. Approximately 26.000 livestock were lost. [1]  The floods provoked substantial displacement, exacerbated by ongoing attacks by Boko Haram, as well as increasing competition over agricultural land. [17]\n\nAs of the end of September 2019, no cases of cholera had been reported, whereas floods in 2014 had affected more than 1,400 people. [17]\n\nPrior to the flood, much of the international humanitarian aid in Niger was concentrated in the Diffa region, due to the high number of Nigerian refugees. [18]  Groups like Doctors Without Borders and UNICEF joined the local and federal government response to the floods, primarily in the most-affected states of Maradi, Tahoua, Agadez, and Zinder. [19]\n\nInitial responses focused on limiting the spread of infectious and communicable diseases such as malaria and diarrhea, and providing mental support. [20]\n\nUNICEF was the sole provider of ready-to-use therapeutic foods in the country,[21] distributed water treatment tablets to some regions, and helped rehabilitate wells affected by floods. [22]  The agency also supported the Niger government’s response by providing non-food item kits, which were distributed by government authorities under coordination of the UN’s Coordinating Committee on Health. [23]\n\nDoctors Without Borders put mobile clinics out into the field where they could promote hygiene practices, monitor outbreaks of disease and distribute non-food items like blankets, mosquito nets, hygiene supplies, and domestic utensils. They also helped dig basic latrines as a stopgap measure for people sheltering in community schools. [24]\n\nThe local government distributed food rations and cooking oil as well as money (2,000 Central African Francs). [20]\n\nAfter years of repeated flooding, in 2012, the Niger government, with support from the World Bank, launched the PGCR-DU (Projet de Gestion des Risques de Catastrophes et de Développement Urbain). By 2016, the PGRC-DU has begun retrofitting numerous protective dikes and developing tools to better predict areas most susceptible to flooding and weigh various flood mitigation measures in those areas.

{"query": "January_2021 The United States Senate votes 84–15 to confirm Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary, making her the first woman to serve as head of the Treasury Department. (MarketWatch) Janet Yellen, the economist who came to Washington in 1994 to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve board of governors and took the town by storm, won Senate confirmation Monday to become the first female U.S. Treasury secretary in history.\nThe vote was 84-15,  with 34 Republicans voting in favor. Analysts said Yellen is viewed by lawmakers as being in some sense above politics. This could come in handy as President Joe Biden fights to pass his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package and an infrastructure bill expected to be unveiled next month.\nMany Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee said they wanted their vote in favor on Yellen to show they were willing to work with Democrats on economic issues.\nAt the same time, GOP members have reservations about some of Biden’s economic priorities, including the proposed $15-per-hour federal minimum wage. And Republicans also don’t want to see a reversal of tax cuts they passed in 2017.\nDemocrats are eager to turn the page on the economic policies of the Trump administration and believe they have an ally in Yellen. Yellen has urged lawmakers to “act big” now to save the economy and worry about the debt later.\nSen. Sherrod Brown, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and a Democrat from Ohio, said the U.S. was “done” measuring the economy by the stock market or corporate profits.\n“We’re going to think about the economy the way workers and their families do — in terms of paychecks, and whether they can make rent or pay the mortgage this month, or afford child care, or pay for their prescription drugs,” Brown said.\nAfter Yellen came to Washington to join the central bank, then headed by Alan Greenspan, she quickly earned a reputation for astute economic analyses. She even famously took on Greenspan in a debate over the path of interest-rate policy, something few on the central bank ever tried.\nPresident Bill Clinton brought her to the White House to be the chair of his Council of Economic Advisers. After a stint as the head of the Fed’s San Francisco regional bank, she returned to the Fed as vice chair in 2010. Three years later, President Barack Obama nominated her to be the head of the Fed. After her four-year term ended in 2018, Yellen did not retire and move back to San Francisco, where she has a home, but instead worked at the Brookings Institution. Her name wasn’t mentioned often by the press as a possible Treasury secretary. Her biography led Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to quip that Yellen belonged in the Senate confirmation “hall of fame.”\n Yellen will need every ounce of her economic talents in her new post. The U.S. government remains on “war footing,” fighting an economic crisis caused by the coronavirus that is worse than the 2008 financial crisis,  said Ken Rogoff, a leading economist and Harvard professor, in a recent interview.  U.S. government debt held by the public is now over $21 trillion. As part of her new job, Yellen will meet regularly with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The central bank has cut its policy rate to zero and is buying massive amounts of government securities to keep the financial markets stable.  On Wednesday, Powell is expected to tell the markets that the Fed isn’t thinking about changing its policy stance even with stimulus from the new Biden administration and the two houses of Congress controlled by Democrats. Fed officials have said repeatedly that Congress and Treasury must do more to help workers and small-business owners through grants and other relief programs. Under the law, the Fed can only lend funds.\nInitial jobless claims rose  37,000 to 412, 000 in the week ended June 12, the Labor Department said Thursday.", "label": [{"name": "任命-就职", "arguments": {"职位": "Treasury secretary", "被任命者": "Janet Yellen", "就职时间": "Monday"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "November_2017 Retired Croatian Army general Slobodan Praljak, upon hearing at a UN tribunal that the international tribunal upheld his war crime conviction, drinks a small vial that apparently contained poison, and later dies in a hospital in The Hague. (The New York Times) (The Guardian)PARIS — The court session in The Hague was meant to be the final act of a decades-long legal process over the atrocities of the Bosnian and Croatian wars. Instead, it descended into confusion and, ultimately, death.\nAs judges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia were delivering rulings on Wednesday on appeals related to Croatia’s involvement in the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict, one of the six defendants, Slobodan Praljak, who was standing, addressed the court.\n“Slobodan Praljak is not a war criminal,” he declared slowly and deliberately in Croatian, just moments after judges upheld Mr. Praljak’s 20-year jail sentence for war crimes and crimes against humanity. “I reject your judgment with contempt.”\nIn a scene befitting the theater director Mr. Praljak had been before the Bosnian war erupted, he pulled out a small container, raised it to his lips and ostentatiously swallowed the contents. He then said, “I have taken poison.”\nMr. Praljak, a tall, distinguished-looking man with silver hair and a goatee, was taken from the courtroom, and the hearing was suspended. Guards seized the container. The curtains that divide the court from the public gallery were drawn.\nIt was an exceptional moment in a room that has been the scene of ritual courtesy among robed lawyers, of witnesses choking on stories of torture and rape, and of once powerful men hurling insults at judges. But never a staged suicide.\nMr. Praljak, a former general, 72, later died in a Dutch hospital, according to Nenad Golcevski, a tribunal spokesman. “Mr. Praljak drank a liquid while in court, and quickly fell ill,” the court said in a statement.\nMany questions, however, remained unanswered, including the most significant one: How did Mr. Praljak obtain poison and smuggle it into the tightly secured courthouse?\nAs is typical, the defendants were transferred to the courtroom from a detention center within a high-security Dutch jail compound near The Hague on Wednesday morning. They are driven into the tribunal building through an underground parking lot, escorted by guards. Detainees have no contact with the public gallery, and any visitors who meet with them in jail — including lawyers, family and friends — pass through a security check.\nDutch investigators and police officers declared the courtroom a crime scene and are carrying out an independent inquiry. Mr. Praljak’s suicide is the third by a defendant facing the tribunal, but the previous two had taken their lives in the court’s detention cells.\nJudges upheld the sentences against all of the six defendants, but the suicide of Mr. Praljak — the most senior member of the group — quickly overshadowed those decisions.\nBefore the Bosnian and Croatian wars, Mr. Praljak had been a theater and film director and a writer. He joined the Croatian Army as a senior official when it was formed after the country achieved independence in 1991. He was eventually named commander of the Croatian forces fighting in Bosnia.\nHe was a key figure, in particular, during the long siege and shelling of the ethnically mixed city of Mostar. The siege was the most widely publicized Croatian military action during the war and included the destruction of the town’s 16th century stone bridge. At the time, he was the main liaison between political and military leaders in Croatia and the Croatian force fighting in Bosnia.\nMr. Praljak had been convicted of a number of crimes, and while the appeals judges on Wednesday overturned some parts of his conviction, they did not reduce his sentence.\nThe hearing also drew attention to Croatia’s often-overlooked role in the Bosnian war.\nThe tribunal has for the past 24 years largely focused on the dominant Serbian role in the conflict, most recently sentencing Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb military commander, to life in prison for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nBut Croatia, trials at the tribunal have shown, also orchestrated brutal ethnic cleansing to seize Bosnian lands once the Yugoslav federation began to disintegrate in 1991.\nSlobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia held secret talks early in 1991 to divide Bosnia. Mr. Mladic, court records showed, had at least two subsequent meetings to discuss the partition with his Croatian counterparts.\nForces led by Mr. Mladic moved first, in 1992. But the next year, Mr. Tudjman’s campaign to occupy lands that he claimed were historically Croatian kicked into gear. Croatia used militia forces to terrorize non-Croats and force them to flee, tactics similar to Mr. Mladic’s, though there was less coldblooded killing, and the numbers of prisoners and refugees were smaller. Mr. Tudjman died in 1999, before the tribunal had completed his indictment.\nProsecutors said militias that were funded and staffed by the Croatian government, and following its orders, rounded up non-Croatian men, imprisoning up to 10,000. Women and the older people were abused, raped and, in some cases, killed. Tens of thousands fled. Most of the victims were Bosnian Muslims, also called Bosniaks, but Serbs and Roma people also suffered.\nThough none of the trials involving Croatia concerned the killings on the scale carried out by Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica or Sarajevo, a dozen ethnic Croats have been convicted by the tribunal for crimes related to their campaign of violent ethnic cleansing.\nThe session on Wednesday delivered a judgment that was much anticipated in Zagreb: it involved six Croats sentenced to prison terms of 10 to 25 years for their roles as military or political leaders during the Bosnian campaign. The judges threw out some parts of the convictions but said all six “remained convicted of numerous and very serious crimes.” They affirmed all the sentences.\nBoth the prosecution and the defense had brought appeals against the judgments handed down against the men.\nProsecutors had sought longer sentences and affirmation from the tribunal that the Croatian government funded and controlled the militias inside Bosnia, following direct orders from Mr. Tudjman.\nThey offered evidence that included extensive records kept by Mr. Tudjman of his conversations, meetings and telephone calls, released to prosecutors after his death, and documents showing that his government sent funds, vehicles, weapons and senior military commanders to run the operations in Bosnia.\nThe defense sought the release of the accused or reductions in their sentences.\nBut the main objective of the Croatian government appeared to be to clear the name of Mr. Tudjman, his defense minister, Gojko Susak, and the commander of the army at the time, Janko Bobetko. Croatian authorities have contended that the three, who have all since died, played no role in the Bosnian violence and were not, as an earlier judgment found, part of a “joint criminal enterprise.” But the appeal did not clear them and upheld the existence of a “criminal enterprise.” Both within Bosnia and in neighboring Croatia, Croatian officials have characterized their actions as defensive.\nTheir reaction to the appeals and the drama on Wednesday indicated, however, that many of the wounds from the conflict remain fresh.\nCroatia’s prime minister, Andrej Plenkovic, denounced the ruling, promising to seek ways to challenge it, and expressed sympathy for Mr. Praljak’s family. Dragan Covic, the Croatian member of Bosnia’s tripartite presidency, declared that Mr. Praljak’s suicide had been “most honorable.”\nThe tribunal’s chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, expressed satisfaction, however, that the judges upheld rulings that the six men in court, “together with senior Croatian officials including President Franjo Tudjman, wanted to seize territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to establish a Croatian entity and facilitate the reunification of the Croatian people.”\nThe Dayton Peace Accord, which officially marked the end of the war in Bosnia, created a complex political structure devised to share power between the country’s Serb, Bosniak and Croat ethnic groups.\nThe timing of the latest ruling was unrelated to last week’s sentencing of Mr. Mladic. But the pair of decisions amounted to a historic moment for the tribunal, with the Croatia judgment expected to be its final act before it closes at the end of the year. It was established by the United Nations Security Council in 1993. A small appellate court will handle pending appeals and the retrial of Serbia’s former intelligence chiefs.", "label": [{"name": "名人死亡", "arguments": {"（死亡的）人物": "Slobodan Praljak", "死亡原因": "poison", "日期": "Wednesday", "职业": "former general", "年龄": "72", "地点/医院": "Dutch hospital"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crashOn April 3, 1996, a United States Air Force Boeing CT-43A (Flight IFO-21) crashed on approach to Dubrovnik, Croatia, while on an official trade mission. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-200 originally built as T-43A navigational trainer and later converted into a CT-43A executive transport aircraft, was carrying United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and 34 other people, including The New York Times Frankfurt bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash. [1] While attempting an instrument approach to Dubrovnik Airport, the airplane crashed into a mountainside. An Air Force Technical Sergeant, Shelly Kelly, survived the initial impact, but died en route to a hospital. Everyone else on board died at the scene of the crash. [2]\n\nThe aircraft was operated by the 76th Airlift Squadron of the 86th Airlift Wing, based at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Unlike civilian 737s, the military CT-43A version was not equipped with a flight data recorder nor a cockpit voice recorder. [3]\n\nThe official US Air Force accident investigation board report noted several reasons that led the Boeing CT-43A, callsign \"IFO-21\" (short for Implementation Force),[4] to crash. [5] Chief among the findings was a \"failure of command, aircrew error and an improperly designed instrument approach procedure\". The inclement weather was not deemed a substantial contributing factor in the crash. [6]\n\nThe Boeing CT-43A used for this flight was formerly a T-43A navigator training aircraft that was converted for distinguished visitor travel. The flight was on an instrument flight rules non-directional beacon (NDB) approach, which is a non-precision type of instrument approach, to Runway 12 when it strayed off course. Non-precision approaches are those that do not incorporate vertical guidance. [7] While NDB approaches are essentially obsolete in the United States, they are still used widely in other parts of the world. Because of their infrequent use in the United States, many American pilots are not fully proficient in performing them (a NASA survey showed that 60% of American transport-rated pilots had not flown an NDB approach in the last year). [3] The investigation board determined that the approach used was not approved for Department of Defense aircraft, and should not have been used by the aircraft crew. [8] The board determined that the particular NDB approach used required two operating ADFs, the instrument used to fly such an approach, on board the aircraft, but this aircraft only had one ADF installed. To successfully fly the approach, one ADF was required to track the outbound course of 119° from the Koločep NDB (KLP), while another ADF was required to observe when the aircraft had flown beyond the Cavtat NDB (CV), which marked the missed approach point. The alternative available to the crew was to repeatedly switch their one ADF between the signals at the KLP and CV beacons, though this would add further workload and stress to the crew. [9] Further, the board noted that the approach was rushed, with the aircraft flying at 80 knots (150 km/h) above the proper final approach speed and had not received the proper landing clearance from the control tower. [8]\n\nThe crash site, on a 2,300 ft (700 m) hill, was 1.6 miles (2.6 km) northeast of where the aircraft should have been on the inbound course to the NDB. The published NDB approach brings the inbound aircraft down a valley, and has a minimum descent height of 2,150 ft (660 m) at the missed approach point (where they should have climbed and turned to the right if the runway was not in view), which is below the elevation of the hills to the north. The runway is at 510 ft (160 m) MSL. Five other aircraft had landed prior to the CT-43A and had not experienced any problems with the navigational aids. There was no emergency call from the pilots, and they did not initiate a missed approach, even though they were beyond the missed approach point when they hit the hill at 2:57 PM local time. [3][4]\n\nEach country is responsible for publishing the approach charts, including minimum descent heights, for its airports, and the investigators noted that the minimum in mountainous terrain in the United States is 2,800 ft (850 m), as compared to the 2,150 ft (660 m) on the chart given to the crew of IFO-21. [9] It was a requirement of the US Air Force to review and approve all charts, and to ban flights into airports for which the charts did not meet the proper American aviation standards. [9] The commander of the 86th Operations Group, Col. John E. Mazurowski,[10] revealed that he had requested (but not yet received) approval to waive the review for Dubrovnik, as the approach had worked for years and the delay of a full review could hamper the interests of the American diplomatic mission. [9]\n\nThirty-five people, six military crewmembers and twenty-nine civilians, died in the crash. Thirty-three of the victims were Americans and two were Croatians. Twelve Department of Commerce officials, including Secretary Brown, and twelve high-ranking CEOs/presidents of many different American companies died. Jim Lewek, a Central Intelligence Agency analyst, Lee Jackson of the Treasury Department, and Nathaniel Nash, the New York Times' Frankfurt bureau chief, were also among the deceased. [11]\n\nDubrovnik Airport was singled out for an improperly designed approach and landing procedure. [9]\n\nA number of US Air Force (USAF) officers were found to have contributed to a failure of command. The general commanding the 86th Airlift Wing, Brig. Gen. William E. Stevens, vice-commander Col. Roger W. Hansen and the commander of the 86th Operations Group, Col. John E. Mazurowski, were all relieved of their posts. [10]\n[12] Mazurowski was later found guilty of a dereliction of duties and was demoted to major, while twelve other officers were reprimanded. [9]\n\nThe USAF ordered all military aircraft to be equipped with a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder. [9]\n\nAmerican military aircraft are no longer allowed to fly into airports without explicit approval from the United States Department of Defense, not even for high-ranking diplomatic missions. [9]\n\nThe area of the crash site is identified by a large stainless steel cross on Stražišće peak. Hikers can reach the peak via the \"Ronald Brown Path\", which is named in commemoration of the U.S. Secretary of Commerce who died in the crash. [13]\n\nA memorial room has been installed in the Ronald Brown memorial house in the old city of Dubrovnik. It features portraits of the crash victims as well as a guest book. [14]\n\nThe head of navigation at Čilipi Airport, Niko Jerkuić, was found dead three days after the accident with a bullet wound to his chest. The police investigation concluded that the case was a suicide. [15]\n\nThe crash of IFO-21 was covered in \"Fog of War\", a Season 4 (2007) episode of the internationally syndicated Canadian TV documentary series Mayday.

{"query": "1992 Rugby League World Cup FinalThe 1992 Rugby League World Cup final was the conclusive game of the 1989–1992 Rugby League World Cup tournament and was played between Great Britain and Australia on 24 October 1992 at Wembley Stadium in London, England. Australia won the final by 10 points to 6 in front of an international record crowd of 73,631. Australia, the defending champions, won the Rugby League World Cup for the 7th time. The crowd of 73,631 at Wembley set a new international rugby league attendance record, eclipsing the previous record of 70,204 established during the first test of the 1932 Ashes series at the Sydney Cricket Ground. [1]\n\nThe Mal Reilly coached Great Britain started their World Cup campaign on 11 November 1989 when they defeated New Zealand 10–6 at Central Park in Wigan. Until the Final, The Lions won another 4 games while losing 3. Nine of the 17 selected players for the Lions were from the 1992 RFL champions Wigan. Australia began their World Cup campaign with a 22–14 win over New Zealand in the third test of the 1989 Trans-Tasman series in Auckland on 23 July 1989. The Bob Fulton coached Kangaroos would win all 8 of their qualifying games. Seven of the players selected for Australia were members of the Brisbane Broncos 1992 NSWRL premiership winning team. Australia were the defending World Cup Champions and had won all three World Cup Finals since 1975. The Kangaroos had won the 1988 Rugby League World Cup Final 25–12 over New Zealand at Eden Park in Auckland. In the fortnight prior to the World Cup Final (following the 1992 NSWRL Grand Final), the Australians embarked on a mini three game tour of England, essentially using the games as selection trial for the Final at Wembley. The Australians wore a non-traditional mostly white jumper with a green and gold diamond pattern in the shape of Kit supplier Umbro. [citation needed]\n\nThe Australian squad for their WCF Tour was:\nMal Meninga (c), Allan Langer (vc), Tim Brasher, Willie Carne, John Cartwright, Bradley Clyde, Brad Fittler, David Gillespie, Brad Godden, Michael Hancock, Paul Harragon, Chris Johns, Glenn Lazarus, Bob Lindner, Graham Mackay, Steve Renouf, Mark Sargent, Paul Sironen, Kerrod Walters, Kevin Walters, Steve Walters. Of the selected squad, only team vice captain Allan Langer, Paul Sironen and David Gillespie had played in Australia's 1988 World Cup Final win over New Zealand. All three would go on to play in the Final at Wembley playing in the same positions and wearing the same numbers (7, 11 and 14 respectively) they had done four years earlier at Eden Park. Before the final, Australia and Great Britain had played each other 119 times, with Australia winning 57 times, Great Britain 57 and 5 draws. Australia had not lost a test series or a World Cup to Great Britain (or England) since the 1972 World Cup. Australia and Great Britain had met in three previous World Cup Finals; 1970 at Headingley Stadium in Leeds (won 12–7 by Australia), 1972 at Stade de Gerland in Lyon, France (the game finished in a 10–10 draw but the Lions were awarded the Cup after finishing on top of the table), and 1977 at the Sydney Cricket Ground (won 13–12 by Australia). As they had done in 1988, Australia won the right to host the World Cup Final. However, in the interests of rugby league and although they were confident of a sell-out if the game was held in Australia after capacity crowds attended all three Ashes Series tests earlier in the year against Great Britain, with the potential for a much larger attendance since at the time Lang Park in Brisbane could only hold 32,500, and the Sydney Football Stadium could only seat 42,500, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) agreed to the Rugby Football League (RFL) hosting the final at the 82,000 capacity Wembley Stadium in London. [citation needed]\n\nThe first half of the World Cup Final was a tight affair. The Lions took the lead early thanks to a penalty goal from Deryck Fox after a spilled bomb in front of the posts by debuting Kangaroos fullback Tim Brasher. Fox put up an attacking bomb and Brasher was tackled by Lions fullback Joe Lydon as he attempted to catch the ball. From there Steve Renouf dived on the loose ball that was only 2 metres in front of the posts and was ruled to be offside. From then on Fox and Kangaroos captain Mal Meninga traded penalty goals until the half with Great Britain going into the break with a 6–4 lead. Great Britain were lucky to have a full complement on the field from about the 20 minute mark of the final after hooker Martin Dermott had caught Australian five-eighth Brad Fittler with an elbow to the face. [citation needed] However Dermott was cautioned by referee Hale rather than sent off. While Meninga kicked a penalty goal, Fittler went to the sidelines where he was cleared of serious injury and returned to the game without being replaced. At half time, Kangaroos doctor Nathan Gibbs diagnosed a hairline fracture of his cheek bone, but cleared him to play on. Great Britain wasn't without its own problems though. Early in the first half fullback Joe Lydon picked up an ankle injury and he would be eventually replaced by Alan Tait in the second half. The Lions would also lose centre Gary Connolly to a leg injury which would see him replaced by a former Welsh rugby union international, John Devereux. [3]\n\nInto the second half the match was becoming a struggle with neither team seriously threatening the others line. The closest either team came to scoring was when Australian winger Willie Carne looked to have scored in the corner but the final pass from Meninga was ruled forward. The home side were still leading 6–4 with only 12 minutes remaining. [4] The only try of the match was then set up by Australian replacement back Kevin Walters who, with a clever cut-out pass, put his Brisbane Broncos teammate Steve Renouf into a gap not covered by replacement Lions centre John Devereux (Walters had replaced lock forward Bradley Clyde who left the field with a dislocated shoulder). Renouf, in his debut test for Australia, then raced 20 metres to score in the corner. [5] Meninga's sideline conversion of Renouf's try gave Australia what would be a match winning 10–6 lead. The rain started pouring midway through the second half and Australia was able to hold Great Britain out and maintain their lead until the final siren. Australian hooker Steve Walters was named the man-of-the-match for the 1992 World Cup Final.

{"query": "Prose and Kohn: Paddlers named to Team USA feel honored despite event cancellationThe 2021 International Dragon Boat Federation World Championships were scheduled to be held in November in Hong Kong. It won't be taking place. The IDBF canceled the event out of COVID-19 concerns. The cancellation is a disappointment for every paddler with dreams of being named to Team USA and competing in it. The United States Dragon Boat Federation and its members are no exception, which is why the USDBF decided to fill out its Team USA rosters anyway. The selections were primarily made based on paddlers' performances at time trials held across the country, including one at Nathan Benderson Park in July.  Five members of the NBP Dragons team were named to Team USA. Paddlers Don Bickel and Doreen Clyne were named to the Men's Senior A (40 and older) small boat roster and the Women's Senior B small boat team, respectively. Angela Long, who is the head coach of the park's paddling program, was also named to the Women's Senior B small boat team. Mandy Kendall Boyers was named to the Women's Senior B standard team while Beth Turconi was named an alternate to the Women's Senior B standard team. Turconi was the park's first Team USA representative in 2019.  No, this quintet will not be competing in Hong Kong. But they're part of Team USA and they're proud of that fact, as they should be.  \"It's overwhelming,\" Clyne said of the honor. \"It's taking all of the work, all of the sacrifices and the training and the coaching, and making it a culmination. It takes a village. It's my efforts but it's also everyone who comes together on the team and pushes each other and strives to be the best they can be.\" Paddlers from the NBP Dragons and Survivors in Sync get in some practice before the Club Crew Championships, to be held Oct. 1-3 at Nathan Benderson Park. Bickel called the entire experience humbling and thanked the program's coaches, including Long, for challenging him and getting him to believe he could reach this point. All of the paddlers shared similar sentiments in that regard. It is clear that the members of this program view every individual victory as a victory for the team as well.  Clyne was emotional when discussing the program. Even though the World Championships are cancelled, the paddlers will get a chance to compete as the Dragons at the 2021 USDBF Club Crew Championships, which will be held at Benderson Park Oct. 1-3. Clyne said it will be wonderful to race for spots in the 2022 IDBF Club Crew Championships with her favorite people after all the encouragement they have given her.  \"There is a family bond here and we are at home here (at Benderson Park),\" Clyne said. \"To be paddling together is going to be awesome. Hopefully we will take home some hardware. To be going for goals like that together is what means so much.\"  It's a cliche for an athlete to say that their team is like a family, but for these paddlers, I can see it being true. Not only are the Dragons competing at the Club Crew Championships but so is Survivors in Sync, the park's dragon boat team made up of breast cancer survivors. Survivors in Sync doubles as a support group for many of its members. The entire sport is about encouragement and overcoming whatever is in your way as a team. It makes sense that even in individual accomplishments, like reaching Team USA, that the paddlers would have their teammates and coaches on their minds.  The Club Crew Championships are free for spectators to attend. Approximately 90 clubs will be participating. Not only will you see high-level dragon boating if you attend, but you'll be supporting the Team USA members who had their championship experience taken from them.

{"query": "The US withdrawal from the Iran deal: One year onOn 8 May last year, US President Donald J. Trump announced that the United States would pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which sets limits on Iran’s nuclear programme to ensure that it cannot produce nuclear weapons. Despite the US withdrawal, the JCPOA remains in force; it is a multilateral agreement to which seven of the original eight parties still adhere. When they arrived at the agreement in July 2015, the parties to it were Iran, the USA, China, Russia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Union. A few days after the JCPOA was agreed, it was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.\nThe JCPOA limits Iran’s uranium enrichment programme until 2030 and contains monitoring and transparency measures that will remain in place long after that date. Along with other international experts, SIPRI’s assessment from the outset has been that the agreement is technically sound with robust verification procedures. The International Atomic Energy Agency is responsible for monitoring Iran’s JCPOA implementation. It has consistently found that Iran is fully living up to its undertakings. In short, well-crafted and properly implemented, the JCPOA closes off Iran’s pathway to nuclear weapons, should it decide to go in that direction.\nHowever, Saudi Arabia, Israel and most US Republican politicians opposed the agreement. Donald Trump made abandoning the deal a keynote of his 2016 election campaign. Like most other critics, he has described as major flaws the JCPOA’s temporary nature and its lack of controls on Iran’s ballistic missile programme. He is also highly critical of Iran’s actions in Syria and elsewhere in the region, which he characterizes as its ‘malign behaviour’.\nThis makes it clear that, rather than an evidence-based technical objection to the agreement or its implementation, the US decision to withdraw from the JCPOA was a political measure aimed against Iran. The time-limited nature of the JCPOA is by no means unique—the major US-Russian strategic arms control agreement, for example, expires in 2021. It is normal in such cases to find an appropriate opportunity to discuss extending the agreement.\nRegardless of its views about Iran’s regional policies and actions—or, indeed, about the policies and actions of its regional rivals such as Israel and Saudi Arabia—the US withdrawal from the JCPOA is ill-conceived and regrettable for many reasons. It undermines the value of multilateral diplomacy and raises questions about the sanctity and sustainability of interstate agreements. Furthermore, it challenges the authority of the UN Security Council, which has unanimously passed a resolution endorsing the JCPOA and calling on all UN member states as well as regional and international organizations to take action to support the agreement’s implementation. US withdrawal from the JCPOA risks seriously weakening trust and confidence in international institutions and arrangements that are essential parts of the global security architecture. In particular, the US action undermines the global effort for nuclear non-proliferation by sabotaging an important and effective anti-proliferation agreement. It is to be hoped that the remaining parties to the JCPOA will find ways to support its continued implementation.\nSubscribe to receive SIPRI updates\nSTOCKHOLM INTERNATIONAL\nPEACE RESEARCH INSTITUTE\nSIPRI is an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament.

{"query": "Tigray mothers share shocking accounts of dire famine conditionsTestimonies from parents of severely malnourished children, medics, IDPs and residents who beg for food suggest dramatic worsening of situation in Ethiopia’s war-hit region. Eighteen-month-old Haftom Hailay is too weak to cry. All the boy, weighing three kilogrammes, can do is sigh in pain. His mother, malnourished herself, has no milk to breastfeed him. Where they came from in Aragure, a village east of Mekelle, the capital Ethiopia’s embattled Tigray region, the need for food is desperate. “One month ago, everything ran out,” Haftom’s mother, Girmanesh Meles, 30 told Al Jazeera. More than 10 months into the conflict, the famine-like conditions, which up until early July were limited to rural areas of Tigray, have now reached the outskirts of Mekelle. “It became normal to spend four days eating nothing,” said Girmanesh, who like others tried to survive by eating sparingly whatever crops her relatives from Mekelle could donate. “I waited for two weeks in the village … hoping someone would help,” she added. “But no one was able to help. Everyone was like us.” Worried about her son’s wellbeing, Girmanesh on September 11 embarked on foot from Aragure to bring Haftom to Tigray’s flagship Ayder Referral Hospital in Mekelle. “My relatives told me to stay in the village, that there is nothing the hospital can do,” said Girmanesh. “[But] watching my boy getting weaker each day, I could not sit and wait until he dies in my hands.” During the past two months, the main hospital in Mekelle has received 60 children with severe acute malnutrition. Of those 60, six have died, according to Dr Abrha Gebregzabher, a paediatrician supervising the treatment of malnourished children at Ayder hospital. Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in November 2020 launched a military offensive to remove the governing party of Tigray, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, accusing it of attacking federal forces. The continuing conflict has killed thousands of people and displaced more than two million – and more recently, has expanded to the neighbouring regions of Amhara and Afar. Communications have been cut off across Tigray since June 29, when Tigrayan fighters retook most of the region. However, Al Jazeera managed to contact people in Mekelle and gather exclusive footage showing the extent of the humanitarian crisis. Interviews with 12 people in the city – including first-hand testimonies of parents currently caring for severely malnourished children, doctors, nurses, internally displaced people (IDPs) and residents trying to survive by begging for food – as well as videos and images taken from inside Ayder hospital suggest the dire humanitarian conditions are worsening. In one image, a small emaciated boy is crying, a feeding tube going into his nose, his skeletal feet covered in wounds. The others show similar scenes. According to the United Nations, more than 400,000 people are facing famine-like conditions and 1.8 million are on the brink of famine across Tigray. The region of some six million people remains under a “de facto humanitarian blockade”, the UN said earlier this month, warning of a “looming catastrophe” and urging all warring sides to allow and facilitate the unimpeded passage of aid. The September 2 statement by Grant Leaity, the UN’s acting humanitarian coordinator for Ethiopia, said a minimum of 100 trucks of food, non-food items and fuel must enter the region every day – but access has been extremely difficult. “Stocks of relief aid, cash and fuel are running very low or are completely depleted. Food stocks already ran out on 20 August,” it added. Separately, the World Food Programme said last week that, since July 12, 445 contracted non-agency trucks have entered Tigray, but only 38 have returned, calling their disappearance “the primary impediment” to stepping up humanitarian response. Ethiopian authorities and Tigrayan officials have traded the blame for the blocking of aid convoys attempting to enter Tigray. According to the United States officials, less than 10 percent of needed humanitarian supplies reached Tigray over the past month due to obstruction of aid access.    In Mekelle, people interviewed by Al Jazeera said the deteriorating humanitarian situation was due to the blockade following the withdrawal of federal troops from the city in late June. “Up until the siege, we were in a relatively better condition because the residents of Mekelle used to bring us food,” said Tesfay Gebretsadik, who fled to the capital from Humera, in western Tigray. “After the siege, all donations stopped. The inflation, and everything gets heavy. Residents are focused on saving their own life.” Al Jazeera reached out to the spokesperson of the Ethiopian prime minister’s office, Billene Seyoum, for a comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication. While aid corridors and telecommunications remain shut, Tigray’s banks have also been cut off from the federal system. This means that it is impossible to send remittances into the region, where cash is running out. “Economic activities are stuck,” Micheal Gebreyesus, 35 a resident in Mekelle told Al Jazeera. “Since early September, we are only allowed to withdraw 1,000 birr (approximately $22; previously 2,000-birr withdrawals were permitted) per month,” he added, lamenting that the sum cannot cover the skyrocketing prices of basic food items. “Teff (essential grain to bake injera) is 6,000 birr ($130.43) per quintal (220 pounds). Cooking oil is 700 ($15) birr and that is if you are lucky to get it in the market. Essential vegetables like tomato and onion are 100 birr ($2.17) per kilo.”  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.  The crisis is driving residents to beg for food, including those like Worknesh Welday who were better off a few months ago. The 25-year-old mother-of-two said she was ashamed she had to go from house to house, knocking on strangers’ doors to ask for a loaf of bread or a small portion of injera. “I am used to spending two days eating nothing. But my children cannot spend more than one day. They cry; I beg so that they stop crying,” said Worknesh. Since the fighting erupted, thousands of people from across Tigray have fled to Mekelle in search of safety. Sheltered in schools, these IDPs people are waiting for food aid. During the past two weeks, four people in Mai’woyni secondary school have died, residents said. “They died … after weeks of starvation. Two of them were elderly and the remaining [were] children,” said Tesfay, the IDP from Humera who spends his days begging outside the school. Meanwhile, in Ayder hospital basic medical supplies and medicines are also running out. Doctors and nurses who spoke to Al Jazeera called on regional authorities and international aid group to support them, warning that most services have been suspended and the food stock for patients has finished. “We are struggling to continue with extremely limited resources. We are struggling to provide food to patients,” said Dr Sentayhu Mesgana, the hospital’s deputy medical head. “We have suspended further diagnosis due to electric interruptions and lack of spare parts. By now, the hospital is only providing basic services.” According to Dr Sentayhu, health centres across Tigray are unable to send patients to the referral hospital due to a lack of fuel affecting ambulance services. “We don’t know how many people are dying across the region from malnutrition. We are disconnected with the health centres due to the telecommunications blackout. We could only know about patients who managed to arrive here. Only a few can make it,” said Dr Sentayhu. “We cannot do adult nutritional support to the general public which is very costly and ineffective given the dire situation we are in.” Inside the hospital, another boy, 13-month-old Gebreanannya Tesfay, cries relentlessly. Doctors weighted him four kilogrammes (8.8 pounds) when he was brought there on August 22. His father, Tesfaye Hiluf, who used to make a decent living as a farmer in Mai’alem, a village on the outskirts of Mekelle, could no longer feed his family. “We ran out of food two months ago. We tried to survive by asking friends for help. There was nothing to eat for three weeks. I could not afford to buy milk for my son when the mother failed to breastfeed him. He cries non-stop,” Tesfaye said. “Listening to his cries, there are days when I contemplate killing myself.” With medical supplies running out, Dr Abrha, the paediatrician looking after malnourished children, feared the worst is yet to come. “The stock of therapeutic milk will run out in three weeks given there are no new cases,” Dr Abrha said. “That means we will suspend the treatments after three weeks.” For now, Haftom and Gebreanannya are still getting the therapeutic milk. Food insecurity in conflict-hit Ethiopian region remains dire, with increasing reports of people dying of hunger. War-hit region facing severe shortage of aid, cash and fuel due to ‘de facto humanitarian aid blockade’, UN says. Since July, 445 trucks have entered Ethiopia’s war-torn Tigray, but only 38 returned – hampering future aid deliveries. The US pressures all sides to stop fighting and negotiate peace in northern Ethiopia.

{"query": "1948 Northwood mid-air collision crashThe 1948 Northwood mid-air collision took place on 4 July at 15:03 when a Douglas DC-6 of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and an Avro York C.1 of the Royal Air Force (RAF) collided in mid-air over Northwood in London, UK (then in Middlesex). All thirty-nine people aboard both aircraft were killed. It was SAS's first fatal aviation accident and was at the time the deadliest civilian aviation accident in the UK. It is still the deadliest mid-air collision in British history. The DC-6, registration SE-BDA and named Agnar Viking, was on an international scheduled flight from Stockholm via Amsterdam to London's RAF Northolt. The Avro York of the 99 Squadron, with serial number MW248, was on a flight from RAF Luqa in Malta to RAF Norholt. The aircraft were two of four participating in a stacking at Northolt. At the time of the accident the SAS aircraft was holding at 2,500 feet while the RAF aircraft was holding at 3,000 feet. However, due to an error in the setting of the atmospheric pressure compensation of the RAF aircraft, it may have been lower. At the time of the collision the DC-6 was ascending, as the pilots had minutes before decided to divert to Amsterdam and to leave the stacking. The SAS aircraft was flying a regular international scheduled flight from Stockholm Bromma Airport in Sweden via Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands to RAF Northolt in London on 4 July 1948. [1] The aircraft, with Swedish registration SE-BDA and named Agnar Viking, was brand new and had first flown earlier that year. It had twenty-five passengers and a flight crew of seven, making a total of thirty-two people on board. [2]\n\nThe Avro York C.1, with serial number MW248, was operated by the 99 Squadron of the Royal Air Force. It was flying a transport mission from RAF Luqa in Malta to RAF Northolt. On board were six crew members and the High Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya Edward Gent, who was returning to London. [3] The weather was poor at the time of the accident. [1]\n\nUpon arrival in the Northolt area both aircraft were placed in a stacking pattern, which in addition to the two involved aircraft included two other aircraft at higher altitudes. Each stack had an intermediate distance of 500 feet. The stacking was regulated by the air traffic control of Metropolitan Zone. Any aircraft entering the stack had to follow orders from air traffic control, which indicated their altitudes and route, and issued gates allowing the aircraft to enter and leave. Air traffic control issued atmospheric pressure measurements (QFE), allowing the aircraft to synchronise their altimeters. [4]\n\nAt 14:12, the York was given permission to enter the Metropolitan Zone at 5,000 feet over Woodley, near Reading. It was at 14:38 told to circle Northolt at 5,000 feet. [1] Air traffic control then gave the Swedish aircraft permission at 14:45 to descend to 2,500 feet. [1] The RAF aircraft was cleared at 14:50 to descend to 4,000 feet. [1] At 14:52 the DC-6 reported \"just passed 2,500 feet; going down\". The controller reminded the pilot that he was only cleared to 2,500 feet and was not to descend. [1]\n\nThree minutes after the DC-6 report at 2,500 feet, at 14:54, the York was cleared down to 3,000 feet. [1] The DC-6 decided to divert to Amsterdam at 14:59 and informed the tower; it was cleared to leave the area at 2,500 feet at 15:03 although this was not acknowledged by the DC-6. [1] Nothing was heard from the York after 14:45 and it did not acknowledge further clearance down to 1,500 ft at 15:05. [1]\n\nThe permission for the York to descend was given at least a minute or two after the DC-6 was cleared from the area, but neither aircraft acknowledged the last messages. [1] At 15:03 the two aircraft collided about 6.4 kilometres (3.5 nmi; 4.0 mi) north of Northolt Aerodrome. [1] An investigation officer from the Ministry of Civil Aviation later reported that the York was above the DC-6, which was climbing. The starboard wing of the DC-6 penetrated the York on the starboard side behind the freight door and detached the York's tail unit. [5]\n\nBoth aircraft crashed into a wood, bursting into flames on impact. [6] After fire and rescue crews put out the fires, the Avro York was found to be completely destroyed by the crash and the only part of the DC-6 that was still intact was the rudder and tailplane, with the rest of the DC-6 also being destroyed by the fire. [6] All seven passengers and crew of the Avro York died and all thirty-two passengers and crew of the DC-6 also died, bringing the total number of deaths to thirty-nine. [2][7]\n\nThe collision was at the time the most lethal aviation accident in the United Kingdom[2] and is still the deadliest mid-air collision in the UK. [8] It now ranks as the fifteenth-most fatal accident in Britain. [2] The accident was SAS's first fatal accident. [9] It was the fourth loss of a DC-6 and the third-most fatal at the time. [2]\n\nA week after the accident it was announced that a public inquiry would be held into the accident, only the third such inquiry held in the United Kingdom for an air accident. [10] The inquiry was chaired by William McNair and opened on 20 September 1948. [1]\n\nThe inquiry report was published on 21 January 1949. One conclusion found that the height separation in force in the Northolt area of 500 feet provided an inadequate margin of safety and recommended that it be increased to 1,000 feet for the Metropolitan Control Zone. The report also discusses the standard setting for altimeters (known as the regional QFF) that had been introduced in May 1948 for aircraft above 1,500 feet within control zones, and that any error in setting the barometric pressure of one millibar gave an error of 28 feet. [11]\n\nWhile the inquiry was satisfied that the air traffic control system was satisfactory it raised three operational errors of concern which may have contributed to the disaster. [11] Specifically it underlined that the air traffic control issued a landing forecast to the RAF aircraft of a local QFF which could have been interpreted by the pilots as a regional QFF; the air traffic control not transmitting a regional QFF according to schedule; and the broadcasting of a faulty QFF to the SAS crew. [12]\n\nThe court found no evidence of error by the Swedish crew, although it noted that the erroneous QFF may have caused the altimeter to be wrong by one millibar.", "label": [{"name": "空难", "arguments": {"计划降落地点": "London's RAF Northolt", "航空公司": "the Royal Air Force (RAF)", "地点": "Northwood in London, UK (then in Middlesex)", "航班号": "Douglas DC-6", "日期": "4 July at 15:03", "事故原因": "collided in mid-air", "人员伤亡": "All thirty-nine people aboard both aircraft were killed", "乘客": "the High Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya Edward Gent", "机组人员": "six crew members"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "1948 Anti-Jewish riots in Oujda and JeradaThe 1948 Anti-Jewish riots in Oujda and Jerada, the latter also known as Djerada or Jṛada, occurred on June 7–8, 1948, in the towns of Oujda and Jerada, in the northeast of the French protectorate in Morocco. In those events 43 Jews and one Frenchman were killed and approximately 150 injured at the hands of local Muslims. \n\nFrench officials argued that the riots were \"absolutely localized\" to Oujda and Jerada, and that it had been \"migration itself - and not widespread anti-Jewish animosity - that had sparked Muslim anger\". [3]\n\nRené Brunel, the French Commissioner for the Oujda region, stated that rioting began when a Jewish barber attempted to cross into Algeria carrying explosives. Brunel wrote that that atmosphere has \"overheated\" as a result of \"the clandestine passage over the border of a large number of young Zionists from all regions of Morocco trying to get to Palestine via Algeria. \"[4] The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that Jewish emigration from Oujda to Palestine was a significant irritant to the local Muslim population, noting that \"It is characteristic that those in this region near to the Algerian border consider all Jews who depart as combatants for Israel. \"[4] Alphonse Juin, Resident General in Morocco, noted that \"the clandestine departure of Jews for Palestine ignited the anger already inflamed by professional agitators. \"[4]\n\nIt has also been suggested that the riots were sparked by an anti-Zionist speech by Sultan Mohammed V relating to the ongoing 1948 Arab-Israeli War, although others suggest that the Sultan's speech was focused on ensuring the protection of the Moroccan Jews.\n\nThe riots began in Oujda, which was at the time the main transit hub for Zionist emigration out of Morocco, given its proximity to the Algerian border (Algeria was at the time part of Metropolitan France), in which 5 Jews were killed and 30 injured in the space of 3 hours before the army arrived. The mob riots in the neighbouring mining town of Jerada were even more violent, with 39 deaths. \n\nAt the time, Morocco was still a French colony, and the French commissioner for Oujda, René Brunel, blamed the violence on the Jews for leaving through Oujda and for sympathizing with the Zionist movement.

{"query": "Justice NewsSAN DIEGO – Acting U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman announced federal drug charges today against Carlos Martin Quintana-Arias of Mexico, following the seizure yesterday of 17,584 pounds of methamphetamine and 388.93 pounds of fentanyl from a commercial trailer attempting entry at the Otay Mesa, California, Commercial Port of Entry. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed that both drug seizures would be the largest in each drug category, for both this year and last year, in the entire United States. \nThe Complaint alleges that on November 18, 2021, at approximately 8:18 p.m., Quintana-Arias, a Mexican citizen, applied for entry into the U.S. as the driver and sole occupant of a 2009 Kenworth Tractor pulling a 1996 Stoug trailer.  Quintana-Arias’ manifest reflected the trailer contained automotive body parts.  However, according to the Complaint, an X-Ray machine detected anomalies inside the trailer and a drug detection dog alerted to the rear door of the trailer. \nFurther inspection of the trailer’s contents revealed a few automotive body parts among 6,266 packages of drugs.  Of the total drug packages, 6,106 packages contained a substance that field-tested positive for methamphetamine; these packages together weighed approximately 7,976.2 kilograms (17,584.33 pounds).  The other 160 packages contained a substance that field-tested positive for fentanyl and weighed approximately176.42 kilograms (388.93 pounds).\n“This is a staggering seizure that demonstrates the extent of our current fight against mass production of methamphetamine and fentanyl. But for the vigilance of our law enforcement partners, this record-breaking deluge of drugs would have caused incredible damage in our communities.” said Acting U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman. “We commend our partner agencies for their tireless work and dedication to preventing these dangerous and deadly drugs from entering our country.”\n“This record-breaking commercial seizure exemplifies the joint efforts of CBP and HSI employees, who work tirelessly each day to protect our Ports of Entry from the threats posed by drug cartels and other transnational criminal organizations,” said HSI San Diego Special Agent in Charge Chad Plantz. “Countless lives will be saved because of this historic seizure of methamphetamine and fentanyl, but make no mistake: drug cartels strive to exploit our borders to further their criminal enterprises every day. The HSI Border Enforcement Security Task Force and the San Diego Imperial Valley High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area task force, in collaboration with CBP, remain vigilant in the mission to disrupt and dismantle every level of the cartels.”\n“Customs and Border Protection is extremely fortunate to have CBP officers with phenomenal skills that enabled them to identify anomalies, leading to use of our technology to confirm and intercept the largest Methamphetamine and Fentanyl seizure nationally within the last two years” said Pete Flores, Director of Field Operations for the San Field Office.  “Our vigilance is critical to our mission and we will continue to make our homeland and communities safer by making sure these dangerous drugs are intercepted.”\nQuintana-Arias was arraigned today on the complaint alleging two violations of Title 21, United States Code, Sections 952, and 960.

{"query": "March_2014 A court in Minya, Egypt, sentences 528 supporters of former President Mohammed Morsi to death for a range of offenses including murdering a policeman and attacks on people and property.  It is the largest mass death sentence handed down in recent history anywhere in the world. (BBC) (The Independent)A court in Egypt has sentenced 528 supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi to death.\nThey were convicted of charges including murdering a policeman and attacks on people and property.\nThe group is among some 1,200 Muslim Brotherhood supporters on trial, including senior members.\nAuthorities have cracked down harshly on Islamists since Mr Morsi was removed by the military in July. Hundreds have been killed and thousands arrested.\nThey are expected to appeal.\nThe verdict now goes to Egypt's supreme religious authority, the Grand Mufti (a senior Islamic scholar), for approval or rejection. Campaigners say that while death sentences are often handed down in Egypt, few have been carried out in recent years. The final trial session will not be held until 28 April, so there is some time left before the sentence is confirmed and there will be time to appeal in that period, says the BBC's Orla Guerin in Cairo.\nThe Muslim Brotherhood has denounced death sentences and Washington expressed shock and concern.\nThe court in Minya, south of the capital, Cairo, issued its ruling after only two sessions in which the defendants' lawyers complained they had no chance to present their case.\nLawyers have accused the presiding judge of \"veering away from all legal norms\" and denying justice to the accused, our correspondent adds. They were convicted, among other charges, of the murder of the deputy commander of the Matay district police station in Minya. Some 147 suspects were in court for the trial - the others were convicted in absentia, reports say.\nThe court also acquitted 16 other defendants. The attacks took place in August after security forces broke up two camps of pro-Morsi supporters in Cairo, killing hundreds of people.\nMr Morsi was ousted by the military last July following mass street protests against his government. He is facing four separate trials\nThere has since been a severe crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood group, as well as on other activists seen as hostile to the military-backed interim government.\nThe Brotherhood has been declared a terrorist organisation and authorities have punished any public show of support for it.\nA second group of 700 Morsi supporters is due to go on trial on Tuesday.\nThe Muslim Brotherhood's spokesman in London, Abdullah el-Haddad, told the BBC the sentences showed that Egypt was now a dictatorship.\n\"It may be just a threat message and there will be appeals to the court and the decision of the court will change, but this is the new Egypt after the coup. This is the new dictatorship that [army chief and defence minister Field Marshal] Abdul Fattah al-Sisi is trying to establish.\"\nMr Haddad said the Muslim Brotherhood's general guide Mohammed Badie was among those convicted, though other reports say Mr Badie is only due in court on Tuesday.\nThe US government also questioned how the defendants could have had a fair trial in just two court sessions - one of which was Monday's sentencing.\n\"It sort of defies logic,\" said Marie Harf, deputy US State Department spokeswoman, adding that Washington was \"deeply concerned\" and \"shocked\".\n\"Obviously the defendants can appeal, but it simply does not seem possible that a fair review of evidence and testimony consistent with international standards could be accomplished with over 529 defendants in a two-day trial,\" she said.\nDefence counsel Mohamed Tousson claimed the judge rushed to sentencing after being angered by a lawyer's request for his recusal at Saturday's opening hearing.\n\"He got very angry, and adjourned the trial for sentencing,\" Mr Tousson said, adding \"It's a huge violation of defendants' rights.\"\nEgypt's foreign ministry defended the court's handling of the trial, saying the sentences had been \"issued by an independent court after careful study of the case\".\n", "label": [{"name": "犯罪 - 判刑", "arguments": {"法院": "court in Minya, south of the capital, Cairo", "判决结果/刑期": "death", "控告": "murdering a policeman and attacks on people and property"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

The New York Police Department confirmed overnight that he was arrested in Manhattan in 2014, but they wouldn't say for what. He also attended Saint John's University in Queens. \nPolice have been searching for the person - or people - responsible for shooting and killing four in the Seminole Heights neighborhood since Oct. 9. Police have said the shootings happened within close proximity to one another, aren't robberies and could be the work of a serial killer. \nPolice had increased patrols in the neighborhood and released surveillance videos of a hooded suspect. In a security video taken moments after 22-year-old Benjamin Mitchell became the first victim on Oct. 9, the suspect is running from the scene.  \n\"I've come up with four reasons why this person is running,\" Dugan said last month. \"One, they may be late for dinner.

Police patrolling nearby heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene to find Naiboa dead.\nPolice found the body of Ronald Felton, 60, in the street on Nov. 14.  Police said Felton had been walking across the street to meet someone when the gunman came up behind him and fired.   \nSeminole Heights is a working-class neighborhood northeast of downtown Tampa that's slowly becoming gentrified. Run-down homes sit next to renovated, historic bungalows, and trendy restaurants have sprung up near auto body shops.\nResidents and business owners have said there are car burglaries and fights between kids, but nothing like this.  The department has received more than 5,000 tips.

{"query": "Air China Flight 112 crashAir China Flight 112 was a scheduled international passenger flight on 15 March 2003 that carried a 72-year-old man infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This man would later become the index passenger for the infection of another 20 passengers and two aircraft crew, resulting in the dissemination of SARS north to inner Mongolia and south to Thailand. The incident demonstrated how a single person could spread disease via air travel and was one of a number of superspreading events in the global spread of SARS in 2003. The speed of air travel and the multidirectional routes taken by affected passengers accelerated the spread of SARS with a consequential response from the World Health Organization (WHO), the aviation industry and the public. [3][4][5]\n\nThe incident was atypical in that passengers sitting at a distance from the index passenger were affected and the flight was only three hours long. Until this event, it was thought that there was only a significant risk of infection in flights of more than eight hours duration and in just the two adjacent seating rows. Other flights at the time with confirmed passengers with SARS did not have the same extent of infection spread. [3]\n\nSome experts have questioned the interpretation of the incident and highlighted that some passengers may have been infected already. The role of cabin air has also come under question and the incident involving Flight 112 has led to some experts calling for further research into patterns of airborne transmission on commercial flights. [6]\n\nThe 2003 SARS epidemic was caused by the then newly emerging subtype of coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was previously unknown in humans. [7] It was first noted in Guangdong, China in November 2002. Three months later, it surfaced in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada. Transmission was primarily through inhalation of droplets from a human cough or sneeze and people affected presented with a fever greater than 38 °C (100 °F) and dry cough, typically appearing as atypical pneumonia. [8]\n\nBy 28 February 2003, the SARS epidemic had reached Hanoi and was considered of global concern, causing the WHO headquarters in Geneva to issue a global health alert on 12 March 2003, the first since the 1994 India Plague epidemic. [9] Led by the WHO, management of the event consisted predominantly of contact tracing, isolating the affected person and quarantining their contacts. [7] The last known case of human-to-human transmission of SARS was in 2004. [10][11]\n\nOf the more than 8,000 people that were reported to develop SARS between November 2002 and July 2003 worldwide, more than half were from mainland China (particularly Beijing), 20% were healthcare workers and 29 countries reported 774 deaths. Although the overall fatality rate was 15%, it rose to 55% in those over 60. [7][12]\n\nOn 15 March 2003, Air China Flight 112, a Boeing 737-300, flew from Hong Kong on a three-hour flight to Beijing carrying 120 people including 112 passengers, 6 flight attendants and 2 pilots. [13] The flight had 88% occupancy. [3]\n\nThe index passenger was a 72-year-old man, LSK, who had been in Hong Kong since 26 December 2002. [14] Later, he had been visiting his sick brother at the Prince of Wales Hospital between 4 March and 9 March 2003, when his brother died. During this time there were known cases of SARS on the same ward and LSK's niece, who had been visiting her sick father, also developed SARS. [3] On 13 March 2003, two days prior to embarking on Flight 112, LSK developed a fever. [3] He then consulted a doctor the next day, one day before taking the flight. [14] He was unwell when boarding the flight and sat in seat 14E. [4] With six people per row, LSK had 23 passengers sitting in front, or in the same row, and 88 passengers sitting behind him. [3]\n\nOne Taiwanese engineering firm had seven employees on the flight. On 21 March 2003, they returned to Taipei. [14] In addition, there was a group of 33 tourists and an official from the Chinese ministry of commerce. [3]\n\nLSK became the source of infection to another 20 passengers and two crew members. [3] Passengers up to seven rows away from him were affected. [4] Of those later interviewed, eight of the 23 in front or to the side and 10 of the 88 behind LSK, caught the virus. [3] The incident became the largest in-flight transmission of SARS, probably due to the presence of a super-spreader. [15]\n\nUpon arrival at Beijing, LSK was seen in hospital but not admitted. The following day he was taken by family members to a second hospital, where he was successfully resuscitated before being admitted with suspected atypical pneumonia.

{"query": "Defence tells Oakey residents toxic pollutants no health risk, just don't eat the local produceA Darling Downs resident is accusing the Defence Department of destroying his livelihood and says a report into the impact of the Oakey firefighting foam contamination scandal does not go far enough.\nOn Wednesday night, the Defence Department held a meeting in Oakey to tell residents there are no likely health impacts from PFAS, a chemical used in a toxic firefighting foam on the Oakey Army Aviation Base that has leeched into nearby groundwater. But a technical expert also said produce from the contamination zone is not fit for human consumption.\nAbout 480 Oakey residents are involved in a class action seeking up $200 million in damages from the Defence Department for declining property values.\nAt the behest of the department, results from groundwater, soil and blood testing were reviewed by an independent company, AECOM, which compiled a health and environmental report and presented it to Oakey residents.\nAECOM technical officer Amanda Lee said home-grown meat, vegetables, fish from Oakey Creek and eggs laid on local properties should not be eaten by residents living close to the contamination zone where high PFAS levels detected.\nThe environmental report showed PFAS had been detected in underground water up to 4 kilometres from the base.\nOakey resident Bernie Earsman, who attended the meeting and has not joined the class action, said the Defence Department had destroyed his dream of retiring on his small rural property with his wife Margorie.\nMr Earsman said the value of his land had fallen from $270,000 to $120,000 and the Federal Government needed to compensate affected residents.\n\"My ambition was that I'd die one day bringing up a bucket of fruit and vegetables to Margorie ... and then came along their Department of Defence and all their rot,\" he said.\n\"I have got enough money in the bank to pay for my funeral, Margorie has enough in the bank to pay for her funeral ... that's it.\"\nHe said the stress of the contamination problems had exacerbated his epilepsy and his wife's glaucoma.\nBefore the meeting, Defence Department spokesman Chris Birrer told the ABC he sympathised with affected residents.\n\"We understand there's a lot of frustration in the community and we understand that there's a lot of stress and anxiety, and we very much understand that the uncertainty has created a lot of anxiety,\" he said.\nMr Birrer said Defence had started two remediation projects, including work on the surface drains and a water treatment facility.\n\"Over the next 12 months the plant ... will treat 100 million litres of groundwater that's treated and then reinjected back into the aquifer, removing PFAS mass from the environment which could otherwise move out to the community,\" he said.\nDefence would also expand a plan to connect residents to reticulated water from Toowoomba.\nAECOM technical officer Paul McCabe said the contamination zone was still growing and authorities were still learning about the chemical.\n\"PFAS is an unusual contaminant compared to most of the things we normally deal with because it does affect soil, it affects groundwater,\" he said.\n\"It migrates very easily in surface and groundwater and it's taken up by plants and animals — there aren't many other contaminants that do all of those things.\"\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)", "label": [{"name": "环境污染", "arguments": {"污染源": "PFAS", "地点": "Darling Downs", "反对污染的人/组织": "Bernie Earsman", "日期": "On Wednesday night", "受害者": "480 Oakey residents", "解决办法": "Defence would also expand a plan to connect residents to reticulated water from Toowoomba"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "Great Pyramid artefact found in Aberdeenfrom inside the Great Pyramid in Giza – the other two being a stone ball and a hook. These three items are collectively known as the Dixon Relics, after the engineer Waynman Dixon who discovered them inside the pyramid’s Queen’s Chamber in 1872. While the ball and hook went to the British Museum, the cedar was donated to the University of Aberdeen in 1946 by the daughter of James Grant, a physician from Methlick, Aberdeenshire, who assisted Dixon with his exploration of the pyramid. After its donation, the wood’s location was forgotten until Abeer Eladany, a curatorial assistant at the University of Aberdeen, found it while conducting a review of the university’s Asia collection. The wood had been placed in an old cigar tin with the Egyptian flag emblazoned across it, so Abeer, who is originally from Egypt herself, knew at once that this item was unlikely to be Asian in origin. Commenting on her discovery, Abeer said: ‘Once I looked into the numbers in our Egypt records, I instantly knew what it was, and it had effectively been hidden in plain sight in the wrong collection. I’m an archaeologist and have worked on digs in Egypt but I never imagined it would be here in north-east Scotland that I’d find something so important to the heritage of my own country!’ Soon after the discovery was made, a sample of the wood was sent for radiocarbon dating, but due to COVID-19 the analysis was delayed. The results have just recently come in, though, and show that the wood probably dates to 3341-3094 BC – more than 500 years earlier than the presumed date of the Great Pyramid’s construction. The reason for this discrepancy is not immediately apparent, but it could be that the wood was from the centre of a particularly long-lived tree. Alternatively, as wood was fairly scarce in ancient Egypt, it may have been treasured and reused over many decades. Further analysis will hopefully provide some more clues.

(Reuters via CNBC Africa) (Ventures Africa) Last Updated: Fri, 08 Jul 2016 05:43:20 GMT 0\nFrom tweets to streets, Zimbabwe social media anger erupts into anti-Mugabe protests. PHOTO: Kremlin\nOrganisers of a general strike against Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe pledged on Thursday to continue action until he falls, as a spontaneous social media movement has coalesced into the biggest uprising against his rule in nearly a decade.\nZimbabweans have been using the Internet in recent weeks to mobilise for street protests against Mugabe's government, bypassing traditional opposition parties as anger grows over his administration's handling of a failing economy.\nMugabe, Africa's oldest leader at 92, has led the former British colony since independence in 1980.\nHis critics say he has presided over the destruction of a once-promising country with policies such as the seizures of white-owned farms; his government blames foreign powers for sabotaging the economy and stirring unrest.\nOn Wednesday, much of the country was shut down by a \"stay away\" general strike, organised by a social media movement that complains of poor public services, 85 percent unemployment, widespread corruption and delays in getting state salaries.\nThe unlikely protest leader is a pastor, Evan Mawarire, who launched the movement - #ThisFlag - to get Zimbabweans to rally round the national flag and speak out against Mugabe policies.\nHe told Reuters the movement had found its voice and was planning more action in the wake of the success of Wednesday's strike, which shut down much of the capital Harare.\n\"We are getting to a place where we are now expressing that we have had enough. What we are doing is about one action, one voice concerning our frustration. Enough is enough,\" he said.﻿\nThe government blames Zimbabwe's precarious financial position on Western sanctions and a slump in prices of its export commodities.\nIgnatious Chombo, the ruling ZANU-PF party's administration secretary, blamed Western embassies in Harare and opposition parties late on Wednesday for trying to cause anarchy.\nA drought has compounded the hardship, while an acute cash shortage means those lucky enough to get paid are unable to get their hands on any money due to daily withdrawal limits at most banks of as little as $50.\nCentral bank plans to circulate local bank notes later this year have caused further anxiety among a population that lost savings and pensions in 2008 when rampant money-printing pushed hyperinflation to more than 500 billion percent.\nZimbabwe last witnessed protests on this scale in April 2007 when opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai led anti-Mugabe demonstrations.\nMawarire's #ThisFlag movement says it will hold another strike next week lasting two days if demands are not met, including the sacking of corrupt ministers, the payment of delayed salaries and the lifting of roadblocks that residents say are used by police to extract bribes.\nOther social media movements have also appeared, such as Tajamuka - 'We refuse' in Zimbabwe's Shona language - which launched spontaneous demonstrations in the last month.\nOn Monday, an impromptu protest by taxi drivers turned violent, with rock-throwing young men facing off against squads of riot police firing volleys of tear gas - scenes unseen since a government slum clearance campaign in 2005.\nLast week, half a dozen protesters stormed a hotel in downtown Harare protesting against Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko's stay there since December 2014, saying this was profligacy by a government which says it has no money.﻿\n\"Clearly there is a coincidence or intersection of national grievances across the board, economic and political, and the immediate concerns of the public servants,\" Ibbo Mandaza, a leading academic and political commentator, said.\n\"That intersection has proved lethal in the last days. We are in a new phase of politics.\"\nDESPERATE FOR MONEY\nMugabe's government is desperate for money and is struggling to finance its $4 billion budget this year. The shortfalls have left soldiers, policemen, doctors and teachers being paid weeks in arrears.\nCitizens have taken to Twitter and Facebook to vent their anger against a ruling party they see as detached from their daily struggles, while it is consumed by internal fights over who will eventually take-over from the ageing Mugabe.\nForeign investment and donor support has dried up and the government in April halved its 2016 growth forecast to 1.4 percent. Independent economists see no more than 1 percent growth.\nHarare runs a hand-to-mouth budget, spending 82 percent of its revenue on wages. That leaves little for infrastructure, medicines in hospitals or books for schools.\nWhile a majority of Zimbabweans live on less than $2 a day and the government cries poverty, citizens complain of cabinet ministers and senior government officials driving fancy cars and jetting off on foreign trips.﻿\n\"How does the government say it is broke when it buys expensive cars everyday? Every day we hear that ministers have stolen money, so it means the money is there,\" said Elen Chaduka, a mother of three, who sells food in central Harare.\nMawarire, the #ThisFlag leader, demanded an end to the lavish lives of party aparatchiks.\n\"We are saying no to government expenditure which is senseless. They are broke because they have mishandled the economy,\" he said.\nPolitical analysts say ruling party division over Mugabe's successor have spilled into state security organs and it may become more difficult to rely on the police to quell political unrest when officers themselves are angry at not being paid.\n\"We have a state which is fatally divided, a security sector which is fatally divided. I can see the government increasingly coming under siege, incapable of responding,\" Mandaza, the political scientist said. \"We are clearly going into a crisis.\"﻿\n", "label": [{"name": "罢工", "arguments": {"罢工原因": "poor public services, 85 percent unemployment, widespread corruption and delays in getting state salaries", "开始日期": "Wednesday", "抵制机构": "Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe", "罢工者身份(学生，工人等)": "pastor", "罢工者": "Evan Mawarire"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}
{"query": "1934 Constantine riotsThe 1934 Constantine riots was an anti-Jewish riot that erupted in the Algerian city of Constantine. The events have also been described as a pogrom. The cause of the Constantine pogrom has been debated for some time. What everyone seems to agree on is that the initial cause of the conflict was a confrontation between Eliahou Khalifa, a Jewish Zouave, and Muslim worshippers in a mosque next to his home. The Muslims said that Khalifa was drunk, and insulted Islam. A report by the Jewish authorities claimed he was not intoxicated, and that after getting into an argument with them, they had cursed his faith and he cursed them and their faith back. The French colonial authorities only reported the Muslim version of events, which most scholars believe is responsible for inciting the pogrom. \n\nThe background of the tension between Jews and Muslims in the city was rooted in the different manner in which Jews and Muslims has been treated in the Algerian state by the French colonial government.\n\nJTA reported on August 8, 1934:\n\n A scene of utter desolation and horror, of Jewish girls with their breasts cut off, of little children with numerous knife wounds and of whole families locked in their homes and burned to death, was described by a Jewish Telegraphic Agency correspondent, who succeeded in reaching this city today. \"It will take days before the world will obtain a true picture of all the atrocities committed by the Arabs during the pogrom on the Jewish quarter,\" the correspondent wired. \"The only comparison I can think of is the Palestine riots of 1929.

{"query": "These scientists are already on the hunt for the next pandemicIn late December, 2013, a 18-month-old boy in a small village in southern Guinea died two days after contracting a mysterious disease. By the middle of January, 2014, several members of his family fell ill with the same symptoms: fever, vomiting and black stools. Two months later the cause of the outbreak was identified: Ebola virus. The subsequent epidemic hit West Africa hard, infecting more than 28,000 people and killing 11,325. Cases were also reported in Italy, Spain, the UK and the US. Christian Happi was the first person to diagnose a case of Ebola in Nigeria, and helped to sequence the virus. But Happi, a professor of molecular biology and genomics at the Redeemer’s University in Nigeria, was frustrated by how inadequate the response was. Hospitals were sharing information through paper, or Excel, if they even had electricity. “There was no coordination,” he says. “It was a big mess.” Every week it took for information about new infections to be sent around, the more the virus was spreading. “I started thinking, how do we create a system that will make information available almost in real-time, so that those that are making decisions can be abreast of what is going on?” says Happi. He decided to create a system that could easily detect viruses, immediately tip off local authorities and halt an outbreak in its tracks. Africa is no stranger to infectious diseases. An estimated 140 disease outbreaks are reported annually across Africa. Diseases such as Ebola, Lassa fever, Zika and West Nile virus all were first identified on the continent. On an index that ranks the countries vulnerable to outbreaks, 22 of the 25 most-vulnerable countries were in Africa. A rich viral biodiversity, combined with a weak surveillance system, a mushrooming population, and poor public health infrastructure means that any disease outbreak is ripe for spreading like wildfire across the continent, and the world. Sky Glass is Not a Good Television By Simon Lucas How To Fix Email … With Science! By Nicole Kobie Your Essential Guide to the Best Tequilas By Joel Harrison All the Good Early Black Friday Deals You Can Get Right Now By WIRED Pardis Sabeti has worked with Happi for over two decades, studying infectious diseases such as Ebola and Lassa fever. (Happi refers to Sabeti, a computational biologist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, as his “academic better half”.) Having experienced firsthand how lethargic and uncoordinated the response to outbreaks was in Africa, they spent years discussing the idea of designing and implementing a better system. One that could quickly detect viral outbreaks, and sound the alarm to local health authorities almost instantly. Such a system could contain an outbreak, stem its spread and potentially prevent a pandemic. In the early 2010s, Happi and Sabeti began to put in applications, and were rejected repeatedly for years. And then Ebola hit. It became starkly clear just how much the system like they were proposing was desperately needed. Finally, in May 2014, they were awarded a grant from the World Bank. Following the Ebola epidemic, they went to work at building their project, calling it Sentinel. Sabeti and Happi have designed their own new diagnostics tests to spot pathogens. One of these is a simple, cheap paper strip test that can detect common viruses. Another can test for hundreds of viruses simultaneously, which could enable hospital lab staff to test patient samples for a whole range of viruses within a day, and previously unknown viruses within a week. Part of the initiative will be setting up a rapid sharing system of data in real-time using mobile applications. In the case that a person in a remote rural village comes down with a viral disease, this can quickly be reported to local health authorities who can then take the necessary measures to contain it. When word of a novel coronavirus outbreak spread, Happi and Sabeti sprung into action. It was the perfect trial run for Sentinel. They had diagnostic testing set up at their hospital sites in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Senegal by early February – before any hospital in the US. They trained local healthcare workers, and Happi’s team is doing diagnostic testing for the 30 million people in Nigeria. Happi’s lab sequenced the first Covid-19 genome in Africa within 48 hours. Less than a decade ago, virus sequencing would have been done by labs abroad. In the project, which is set to last until 2025, the system is being piloted first in Nigeria. The team will then move further afield, to countries such as Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo But the pandemic has meant that everything has had to speed up. “The timeline that we had set for ourselves, a five-year proposal to do this work, is definitely way too slow,” says Sabeti. One of the goals of Sentinel is to train healthcare workers in Africa, so that Sentinel detection tools become part of their everyday life. Over the next five years, they plan to train 1,000 medical workers. Happi moved to the US to work at Harvard, but after a decade, he decided to return home to Africa, settling in Nigeria. He is passionate about empowering African scientists to take back control. “I see no reason why Africa shouldn't be the leaders in the field of infectious disease prevention and innovation,” says Happi. During the Ebola epidemic, researchers from Western countries flew in, collected thousands of samples and left. These experiences have left Happi wary of what is known as ‘parachute science’ – where scientists from other countries fly in and take whatever data they need to further their own research. He is all for collaboration with other countries, but that relationship must be symbiotic. “I believe in equity; I don't believe in exploitation.” All the people from abroad who came to Africa to aid in the response to Ebola actually “left the country worse,” he says. There are a lot of obstacles around Sentinel that must be rectified before it can fulfil its promise, says Chikwe Ihekweazu, director general of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Prerequisites such as being able to transport samples while controlling temperatures, reliable internet access and security all need to be put in place. Sky Glass is Not a Good Television By Simon Lucas How To Fix Email … With Science! By Nicole Kobie Your Essential Guide to the Best Tequilas By Joel Harrison All the Good Early Black Friday Deals You Can Get Right Now By WIRED But a system like Sentinel in a place like West Africa will be critical in saving lives, Ihekweazu says. “We live in the middle of the tropics, a dense ecology, the temperature is very hot, very high population density – it's a perfect environment for viruses to spread.” And nobody in Africa wants to send samples across the world anymore, he says. “We want to do our science.” Not only could an early-warning system for viral threats potentially curb a global outbreak, it will also mitigate the devastating impact these diseases have on African communities on a regular basis. At least 35 per cent of total deaths reported on the continent annually are due to infectious disease. “African people are very familiar – sadly – with infectious disease,” Sabeti says. “But that also means they're very well poised and positioned to do this.” ", "label": [{"name": "疾病爆发", "arguments": {"疾病名称": "Ebola and Lassa fever", "受影响地区": "small village in southern Guinea", "预防措施": "setting up a rapid sharing system of data in real-time using mobile applications", "日期": "late December, 2013", "死亡病例": "11,325", "症状": "fever, vomiting and black stools", "原因": "A rich viral biodiversity, combined with a weak surveillance system, a mushrooming population, and poor public health infrastructure", "确诊/感染病例": "more than 28,000 people", "疫情数据发布机构": "Nigeria Centre for Disease Control"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

The CAPSTONE mission, which was originally scheduled to launch in early 2021 from the space agency's Wallops facility in Virginia, will now launch in the fourth quarter of 2021 from Rocket Lab's launch site in New Zealand.  CAPSTONE (the Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment) comes to support NASA's Artemis program, which will land the first woman and next man on the Moon by 2024. NASA's CAPSTONE CubeSat will be launched to a unique lunar orbit using Rocket Lab's Electron rocket and Photon Lunar spacecraft. Electron will launch the CAPSTONE satellite, then use the Photon spacecraft as a trans-lunar injection stage to deliver the 55-pound (25 kg) satellite on a path beyond Earth's orbit to the Moon for the first time. After Electron takes off and completes its initial elliptical low Earth orbit, the Photon spacecraft will separate from it and use its own engine. Powered by a HyperCurie engine, it will have enough in-space propulsion in order to allow CAPSTONE to break free of Earth's gravity and start a course for the Moon. Photon will then continue on its own trajectory after launching the CAPSTONE satellite, performing a lunar fly-by, while CAPSTONE will reach a cislunar orbit using its own propulsion system. The main goal of CAPSTONE is to test and verify the orbital stability of a near-rectilinear halo orbit around the Moon, which is the same orbit that the Lunar Gateway will use. The Gateway is a proposed space station (smaller than the ISS) that will orbit the Moon and enable access to the lunar surface for astronauts. While in cislunar orbit, CAPSTONE will also test a navigation system that will determine its position in relation to NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter without the use of ground stations.

(Gulf News)[permanent dead link] (CNBC)  Kuwaiti oil and gas workers have ended a three-day strike that  had temporarily cut the OPEC member’s crude production by nearly  half, the trade union said in a statement posted on its Twitter  account.   “In honor of his highness the Emir ... we have decided the  following. First, the cancellation of the general strike and the  attendance of all oil sector workers at their places of work  beginning at seven in the morning on Wednesday 20 April 2016,”  the Oil & Petrochemicals Industries Workers Confederation  wrote.   The union further pledged “to make every effort to immediately  return production to its previous level.”   News of the strike’s end came just hours after Kuwait’s oil  minister had ruled out negotiations with the employees until they  stopped their action, while one of the union leaders said the  thousands of workers would hold out until planned public sector  pay cuts were canceled.   U.S. oil prices fell slightly after the news.

[1][2]\n\nThe DC-3 was piloted by Arthur \"Slim\" Werkhaven of Sturgis, Michigan, with co-pilot Edward Agner of Battle Creek, Michigan, and was being flown from Battle Creek en route to Lexington, Kentucky. They were to pick up Mr. and Mrs. Fredrick Van Lennep. Mrs. Van Lennep, the former Frances Dodge, was an officer of the firm that owned the plane and founded the Dodge Stables at Meadow Brook Farm, later moving Dodge Stables to Castleton Farm in Lexington. The plane would have carried the Van Lenneps to Delray Beach, Florida. The Martin 2-0-2A had just taken off from the airport on Runway 22 and was climbing in a right turn through a cloud base at 700–900 ft when the collision occurred about 9:00 am. [3]  The DC-3 was en route from Michigan flying VFR heading roughly south towards Lexington. The right wing of the Martin 2-0-2 struck the left wing of the DC-3, which caused the right wing of the Martin to separate and the DC-3 experienced fuselage, rudder, and fin damage. Following the collision, both aircraft crashed out of control, hitting the ground about two miles apart. The wreckage of one of the aircraft fell along Hebron-Limaburg Road, two miles northeast of Burlington, Kentucky. The crash had no survivors from either aircraft. The control tower, operated by the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA), reported that it had no record of a flight plan for either aircraft. A CAA spokesman said that radio messages from the TWA plane shortly after takeoff indicated the pilot was \"alarmed and excited\". [4] The spokesman also said the pilot was cleared for takeoff and to make a right turn out. TWA later filed a $2 million damage suit against the Castleton Corporation of Kentucky. [5]\n\nThe probable cause was determined to be operating the  DC-3 in a controlled zone with unknown traffic, i.e. no clearance received and no communication with the airport tower.

{"query": "2002 Tampa Cessna 172 crashOn January 5, 2002, Charles J. Bishop, a high-school student of East Lake High School in Tarpon Springs, Florida, United States, stole a Cessna 172 light aircraft and crashed it into the side of the Bank of America Tower in downtown Tampa, Florida. The impact killed the teenager and damaged an office room, but there were no other injuries. Bishop had been inspired by the September 11 attacks; he had left a suicide note crediting Osama bin Laden for the attacks and praising it as a justified response to actions against the Palestinians and Iraqis and said he (Bishop) was acting on behalf of Al Qaeda, from whom he had turned down help. As officials could find no other evidence of any connections, terrorism as a motive was ruled out, and they suggested that the crash was an apparent suicide. Bishop's mother filed, then dropped, a lawsuit claiming that psychological side effects from isotretinoin, an acne medicine Bishop took, which can include depression and rarely suicidal actions, caused the incident. At 5:00 p.m. EST, 15-year-old Charlie J. Bishop's flight instructor left him at the plane to perform basic preflight inspection. Once he was left alone inside the plane, he started the engine and took off without permission. [1] As soon as the plane took off, the air traffic controllers alerted the United States Coast Guard and the MacDill Air Force Base. Despite repeated warnings from a helicopter dispatched by the Coast Guard, the small plane continued on in flight until it crashed into the Bank of America tower. The plane crashed between the 28th and 29th floors of the 42-story building. [1][2]\n\nBishop was a 15-year-old high-school student from Tarpon Springs, Florida. At the time of the incident, he was a student pilot and only authorized to fly with a Certified Flight Instructor. [citation needed]\n\nAn investigation followed the incident. Officials ruled out terrorism although eyewitnesses said that the plane made no apparent attempt to avoid hitting the building. Officials finally suggested that the crash was an apparent suicide. In addition, a note found in the wreckage stated that he voiced support for Osama bin Laden. However, there is no evidence that the teen had any connection with any terror group. A suicide note from Bishop was found stating:[3]\n\n\"I have prepared this statement in regards to the acts I am about to commit. First of all, Osama bin Laden is absolutely justified in the terror he has caused on 9-11. He has brought a mighty nation to its knees! God blesses him and the others who helped make September 11th happen. The U.S. will have to face the consequences for its horrific actions against the Palestinian people and Iraqis by its allegiance with the monstrous Israelis—who want nothing short of world domination! You will pay—God help you—and I will make you pay! There will be more coming! Al Qaeda and other organizations have met with me several times to discuss the option of me joining. I didn't. This is an operation done by me only. I had no other help, although, I am acting on their behalf.\" Later authorities confiscated a computer from Bishop's parents' house to try to determine a motive for the incident. Moments after the incident, President George W. Bush was briefly informed about the incident and two unrelated crashes that same day. [1]\n\nIn April 2002, transcripts obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration revealed new details about the incident, which included how close the small plane came to a Southwest Airlines flight. [4]\n\nBishop's mother filed a $70 million (2002 USD) lawsuit against Roche Laboratories, who make an acne medicine called Accutane. According to the lawsuit claim, the medicine had side effects such as depression and suicidal actions, which the claim stated as the cause of the incident. The suit was dropped on June 26, 2007, by Bishop's mother, who stated she was physically and emotionally unable to continue the action. [5]\n\nAfter the incident took place, numerous security measures were taken. The FAA released a security notice on January 6, the day after the incident. The notice included security of the aircraft and regulations pertaining to underaged flight students. In addition, the EAA and other smaller aircraft organizations proposed more security of flight schools and small aircraft. [6][7]\n\nWhile authorities stated that the crash was due to an \"abuse of trust\" rather than a security breach, others argue for the need of increased security due to the simplicity of such actions.

{"query": "Lake Ontario shipwreck photos captured by Greece photographerSince 1974, when he was 13 years old, Jim Montanus has been fascinated by the Laura Grace, a wood tugboat that sank in Lake Ontario during a winter storm in 1918. But rarely had he glimpsed the 76-foot vessel, built in 1901 in Collingwood, Ontario, Canada, through anything but murky water. And never had he gotten a full view of the wreckage, mostly embedded in the lake floor about ¼ mile offshore from where Edgemere Drive and Long Pond Road meet in Greece — a site he said he’s snorkled to “dozens and dozens of times” throughout his life. Last week, though, the photographer said “a perfect storm” formed to give him an unobstructed view of the craft's remains, which are around 12 feet below the lake’s surface, from stem to stern. Actually, it was more of an anti-storm: a combination of relatively calm waters, dry conditions — which reduced runoff into the lake from the sediment-laden Genesee River — and an offshore breeze that allowed cold, clear water to push to the surface. All those circumstances created “perfect viewing conditions,” he said, “where you could see the outline of the entire boat so clearly. It’s amazing that so much of it is still there.” Montanus is known for his lakeside photography — “usually of sailboats or the Charlotte Pier at sunset. That sort of thing.” He had shot images and video of the Laura Grace before, both from the lake’s surface and beneath it, but only had been able to capture portions of the boat, like its prominent steam boiler. Jim Kennard, a shipwreck explorer who lives in Perinton, has chronicled 600 Lake Ontario shipwrecks and authored the book Shipwrecks of Lake Ontario, remembered diving to the Laura Grace during the 1970s, at which point, he said, “You could stand on the boiler and your head would be out of the water.” But as Montanus looked down at it from his small fishing boat, the Greece resident pondered a wider view. “It just occurred to me,” he said, “‘Why don’t I fly my drone?’” The next day, on June 9, amid more stellar weather, he did. From his fishing boat, he sent up his DJI Mavic 2 Pro over the wreckage site, and in about 20 minutes shot video and six or so stills. When he saw the results, “I was thrilled,” he said. “I was completely excited. I knew immediately they were the best pictures I’d ever gotten of that shipwreck.” He asked a couple of paddle-boarders who happened by to get into the frame to help illustrate the tugboat’s scale. “It was perfect,” he said. “They loved it.” Montanus used a polarizing filter on his drone's camera lens to reduce reflection from the water, but he didn't do much to enhance the images after the fact, he said. “I just went through the normal process that most photographers go through with color correction and brightness and contrast. All the normal standard adjustments that most photographers do.” The experience was a far cry from his first encounter with the Laura Grace, whose small crew is said to have survived, and which he learned about from a childhood friend he described as a “science nerd.” “When we were kids, a bunch of us went out to the lake in an attempt to find it,” he said. “We put on masks and snorkels and fanned out and swam around in a pattern trying to locate the ship. And I remember the first time I came upon it, seeing the big hull. It was kind of scary to come across something like that when you’re kind of young.” ", "label": [{"name": "船只失事", "arguments": {"船次": "the Laura Grace", "地点": "Lake Ontario", "日期": "during a winter storm in 1918", "找到失事船只的地点": "around 12 feet below the lake’s surface", "事故调查者": "Jim Kennard"}}], "dataset": "DocEE-en", "task": "EE", "lang": "en"}

The attack began around the time government officials were expected to arrive at the campus for the opening of an Iranian book fair. The gunmen are killed during a battle with security forces. ISIL claims responsibility for the attack. (BBC)At least 22 people have been killed by gunmen who stormed Kabul University before engaging security forces in an hours-long battle on Monday.\nA spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry said the attack was eventually stopped when three gunmen were killed.\nA regional Islamic State group claimed responsibility in a statement.\nThe attack began shortly before the expected arrival of government officials for an Iranian book fair and continued for several hours.\nA further 22 people were wounded by the attackers. Tuesday has been declared a national day of mourning by the government. The Taliban denied involvement and condemned the attack shortly after it began on Monday. Hours later the Islamic State group issued a message on the Telegram app saying it had targeted \"the graduation of judges and investigators working for the apostate Afghan government\". IS has previously targeted education centres in Afghanistan, including an attack outside a tuition centre in Kabul last month that left 24 people dead. The group also claimed responsibility for a 2018 attack in front of Kabul University in which dozens were killed.\n In a statement issued by the presidential palace, President Ashraf Ghani said authorities would \"take revenge for this senseless attack\".\nVideo footage from the university campus on Monday showed students running away from the site with the sound of gunfire in the background. Some scaled walls in an effort to escape. One of the attackers detonated explosives at the beginning of the assault, according to a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.\nFraidoon Ahmadi, a 23-year-old student, was in class when the gunfire started: \"We were very scared and we thought it could be the last day of our lives. Boys and girls were shouting, praying and crying for help,\" he told the AFP news agency.\nAnother witness, Fathullah Moradi, told Reuters the gunmen were \"shooting at every student they saw\" and \"even shot at the students who were running away\".\nViolence in Afghanistan has worsened in recent months even as the Taliban conducts peace talks with the government in Doha, Qatar. The talks, which follow an earlier agreement between the Taliban and the US in February aimed at ending the conflict, have stalled over preliminary issues.\nA senior UN official told the BBC last week that al-Qaeda was still \"heavily embedded\" within the Taliban, despite assurances from Taliban officials to the US that it would sever ties with the terror group. Separately on Monday, a vehicle hit a roadside mine in the country's southern Helmand province, killing at least seven people, most of them women and children, according to the provincial governor's spokesman Omer Zwak.\nNowhere and no-one seems secure in Afghanistan's terrifying everyday violence. \"Books, pens and students are no longer safe,\" lamented one Afghan journalist on Twitter in response to Monday's attack.\nThe bloody assault on Kabul University came about a week after a devastating attack on an education centre in the city which killed more than 40 young students. That attack, in a predominantly Shia Muslim neighbourhood of Kabul, was claimed by the Islamic State group. The Taliban were quick to say the Kabul University raid wasn't their doing, pointing the finger instead at \"evil elements\" linked to the \"Kabul administration\". The Afghan government now regards these despicable attacks on civilians as the work of a seamless web of groups with guns determined to wreak havoc and wreck hope in Afghanistan. Afghans are reeling - from this violence and from the escalating war between security forces and Taliban fighters on front lines across the country.
